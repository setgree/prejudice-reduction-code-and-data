Extant theories predict greatest prejudice reduction following contact with typical outgroup members. In contrast, using subjective group dynamics theory, we predicted that imagining contact with anti-normative outgroup members canpromote positive intergroup attitudes because these atypical members potentially reduce intergroup threat and reinforce ingroup norms. In Study 1 (N = 79) when contact was imagined with an anti-normative rather than a normative outgroup member, that member was viewed as less typical and the contact was less threatening. Studies 2 (N = 47) and 3 (N = 180), employed differing methods, measures and target groups, and controlled for the effects of direct contact. Both studies showed that imagined contact with anti-normative outgroup members promoted positive attitudes to the outgroup, relative both to a no contact control condition and (in Study 3) to a condition involving imagined contact with an ingroup antinormative member. Overall, this research offers new practical and theoretical approaches to prejudice reduction.","10.1016/j.jesp.2018.02.004","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117303852', 'https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=core_ac_uk__::a0c2fec8a6a8ec9ea87e0c330a701c1c","articles+","0.0","2","1.0","3.0","37.33","9","US","3","11","5","0:01","1 day","1","0","imagined contact with anti-normative outgroup members","imagined outdoor walking","3","outgroup prejudice","-1.0","1.0","0.0","57.0","-","61.0","-","dim","-0.74","1.0","0.0","1.84","215, 5.3.2","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",5

We automatically match other people's motor responses, allowing us to get “under the skin” of other people. Although this perception–action-coupling—a form of motor resonance—occurs spontaneously, this happens less readily with the outgroup (vs. the ingroup) and for those high (vs. low) in prejudice. Thus, prejudice diminishes our tendency to resonate with the outgroup. Here we suggest that the reverse is also possible—that resonating with the actions of an outgroup member can reduce prejudice. We predict, in other words, that explicitly mimicking the outgroup can reduce prejudice. Participants watched a 140-second video depicting actors repeatedly reaching for and drinking from a glass of water. They passively watched a video with Black actors; watched the video and mimicked the Black actors; or watched and mimicked a video with actors from their ingroup. Participants then completed the Affect Misattribution Procedure (Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005), a measure of implicit anti-Black prejudice, and an explicit symbolic racism measure. Results indicate that the outgroup-mimicry group had similar implicit preference for Blacks and Whites, unlike the other two groups, which preferred Whites over Blacks.

The current study examined the direct and indirect impact of the Second Step Middle School Program (Committee for Children, 2008) on bullying, cyberbullying, homophobic name-calling, and sexual harassment perpetration over the course of a 3-year randomized clinical trial. Delinquency was examined as an intervening variable between treatment condition and aggression outcomes. Thirty-six schools in Kansas and Illinois were assigned to either a Second Step condition or a control condition, and 3,651 sixth-grade students completed self-reported surveys at four time points across 3 years. Students in the Second Step condition received a total of 41 lessons across the 3-year study. No direct intervention effects were found for multiple forms of aggression perpetration at the end of 3 years. However, as hypothesized, decreases in self-reported delinquency (intervening variable) over the first 2 years were significantly related to decreases in bullying, cyberbullying, and homophobic name-calling perpetration for Second Step schools across the 3-year study. Indirect effects of the Second Step program on bullying and aggressive behavior were statistically significant through reductions of delinquency.

"26","The effect of counterexemplars and victim expectations on crime perceptions and hostile attitudes toward racial minorities","Waddell, F. T.","2017.0","International Journal of Communication","Heavy consumers of crime news are more likely to hold negative attitudes and stereotyped expectations of racial minorities. Attempts to reduce stereotyping with counterexemplars that portray racial minorities in a positive light have yielded mixed results. Do prior crime expectations or frequency of crime news exposure moderate the efficacy of counter-exemplar interventions? An experiment (N = 240) was conducted to test this question using a 2 (exemplar typicality: atypical victim vs. no victim control) √ó 2 (victim expectations: White vs. Black) between-subjects design. Results revealed that counterexemplars that conflicted with viewers' preexisting victim expectations decreased hostile attitudes among light consumers of crime news, but increased racial stereotyping among heavy news consumers. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for media psychology are discussed. ¬© 2017 T.

We analyzed the texts produced on the basis of the linguistic category model. As expected, participants were more likely to describe the outgroup member using less abstract terms when we asked them to take the perspective of a Maghrebian. Since the level of abstraction of the terms used to describe a person’s behavior is considered an index of stereotype use, one might describe Maghrebians less stereotypically when he or she can see the world from their perspective.

"63","A lose -lose situation: Agreeableness and prejudice towards overweight women","Bruce Graham, Jennifer Weisho","2008.0",NA,"Prejudice and discrimination directed towards the overweight has been largely explained by the perception that the overweight are responsible for membership in the stigmatized group. The role of personable accountability for the stigmatizing condition allows one avenue for perceivers to justify prejudice towards the overweight. The goal of this research centered on identifying important predictors of negativity towards the overweight. In study 1 and 2, we varied the weight related individuating information presented to assess its influence on subsequent evaluative judgments. In study 1, we examined the influence of self-improvement information on the evaluative judgments of overweight females. In study 2, we examined the influence of more distally related weight information and its influence on evaluative judgments. Across two studies, we found consistency between evaluative responding and agreeableness, persons higher in agreeableness reported overall more favorable liking ratings of the overweight females than persons lower in agreeableness. The present research brings attention to the controllability of weight in prejudicial judgments. This research also directed further attention to the clarification of negativity and selectivity in the components of prejudice.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/304502372","articles+","0.0","3","2.0","1.0","20","4","us","1","7","5","0:05","1 day","1","0","self-improvement not related to weight loss","no information","3","liking","1.0","1.0","0.0","58.66666667","-","58.66666667","-","-","0.0","0.0","0.0","-","28.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",21

In such sessions students are able to interact socially with a person that has a mental illness. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy in a multi-centre study of pharmacy students. The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at three sites. Because it was necessary that all students receive the contact-based sessions, the students were randomized either to an early or late intervention, with the late intervention group not having participated in the contact-based education at the time when the primary outcome was assessed. The primary outcome, stigma, was assessed using an attitudes scale called the Opening Minds Survey for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC). We initially confirmed that outcomes were homogeneous across study centres, centre by group interaction, p = 0.76. The results were pooled across the three study centres. A significant reduction in stigma was observed in association with the contact-based sessions (mean change 4.3 versus 1.5, t=2.1, p=0.04). The effect size (Cohen's d) was 0.45. A similar reduction was seen in the control group when they later received the intervention. Contact-based education is an effective method of reducing stigma during pharmacy education. These results add to a growing literature confirming the effectiveness of contact-based strategies for stigma reduction in health profession trainees.","10.1186/1472-6920-12-120","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216787', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1265832400', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1273114907', 'https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::f3f87aea7ff22635f32644d424006963', 'https://doaj.org/article/00bc448db97745c6bcc4ff930a628054","articles+","0.0","3","1.0","-","23.8","4","canada","2","8","12","1:30","1 day","0","0","early","late","3","Opening Minds Survey for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC).","-1.0","2.0","2.5 days","36.0","-","51.0","-","did","2.1","1.0","0.0","7.469351163","6 table 3","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",26

Experiment 1 demonstrated that learning that ingroup members categorized the ingroup (Spaniards) and outgroup (Eastern European immigrants) within a common identity (European) produced more positive intergroup orientations toward immigrants. By contrast, learning that outgroup members held the same position elicited less positive orientations compared with a condition in which the information came from a neutral source. The effects were mediated by one-group representations. Experiment 2 also found that endorsement of a common identity generated more positive intergroup orientations when it was expressed by ingroup than outgroup members and revealed how this effect may be sequentially mediated by personal one-group representations and symbolic threat.","10.1177/0146167213475366","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167213475366', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456560', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1317853252","articles+","0.0","2","1.0","1.0","14.83","3","Spain","1","3","3,8","0:05","1 day","1","0","ingroup source","neutral source","3","postive intergroup orientation","1.0","1.0","0.0","18.33333333","-","18.33333333","-","dim","0.81","1.0","0.0","0.63","423,1","0.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","0.0",35

A large amount of research has borne out some of these concerns, linking video games with addiction and particularly aggression. However, recent work in this area has begun to examine the positive aspects of video gaming. In this work, we examine how playing casual, low-involvement video games with an outgroup member may reduce prejudice. In Study 1, participants played cooperatively or competitively with a (trivial) outgroup member or alone. In Studies 2 and 3, a meaningful social identity was used: students' university affiliation. Participants played either cooperatively with a rival university student against the computer, or alone. Analyses of all three studies showed that attitudes toward the outgroup were more positive after playing with an outgroup member compared with control conditions. How these findings may be applied to real world groups and extensions for future research are then discussed.","10.1080/10447318.2016.1212484","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10447318.2016.1212484","articles+","0.0","2","1.0","1.0","22.34","4","UK","1","10","4","0:05","1 day","1","0","cooperative condition","playing alone","3","attitude toward the outgroup","1.0","1.0","0.0","29","-","29","-","dim","0.51","1.0","0.0","0.96","915.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",36

In the context of intergroup transgression, the defensiveness against social identity threat has the effect of undermining collective guilt and its prosocial consequences. However, there may be ways for perpetrator groups to alleviate threat without undermining guilt. Five studies examined whether perpetrator groups are more willing to acknowledge collective guilt once social identity threat has been buffered by ingroup-affirmation. As predicted, Study 1 revealed that men accepted greater collective guilt for the mistreatment of women after affirming their ingroup. Replicating this effect, Study 2 revealed that, following ingroup-affirmation, Canadians accepted greater collective guilt over the mistreatment of Aboriginal children in residential schools. In light of the theoretical distinction between collective guilt and collective shame, Studies 3 and 4 examined the effect of ingroup-affirmation on each emotion. Results revealed that, as with collective guilt, Canadians accepted greater collective shame following ingroup-affirmation. More importantly, ingroup-affirmation moderated the relation of each emotion with compensation. Specifically, when controlling for each other, collective shame predicted compensation only when social identity threat was left unchecked, whereas collective guilt predicted compensation only when social identity threat had been disarmed by ingroup-affirmation. Finally, Study 5 provided direct evidence that the effect of ingroup-affirmation is mediated by defensiveness. Specifically, ingroup-affirmation lowered defensiveness, which in turn freed group members to acknowledge greater collective guilt and greater collective shame.

The present research tested whether providing participants with implementation intentions (""if-then"" plans) that specify how to act when feeling anxious boosted interest in sustained contact and close interpersonal distance. Implementation intentions led to increased interest in sustained contact during anxiety-provoking interactions in the laboratory (Study 1) and daily interracial interactions (Study 2). They also led to closer interpersonal distance in anticipation of interracial interactions (Study 3). Implementation intentions were more effective than forming goal-directed responses (Studies 1, 2, & 3), or not forming a self-regulation strategy (Studies 2 & 3), and were effective over multiple interactions and across time, despite being learned only once (Study 2). Participants across conditions reported similar levels of anxiety, suggesting that promoting an interest in sustained contact can be accomplished without reducing anxiety, but rather, by shielding individuals from the negative effects of anxiety during social interactions.","10.1016/j.jesp.2013.09.008","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103113001716","articles+","0.0","3","1.0","2.0","24","4, 9","US","1, 3","1","9,14 (motivation)","0:20","1 week","1","0","implementation intention + goal","no strategy","3","feeling thermometer (positive outgroup attitudes)","1.0","2.0","1 year","11.33333333","-","11.33333333","-","dim","14.93","1.0","0.0","15.48590757","88.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","0.0",38

Evidence from a Field Experiment in Nigeria","Scacco, Alexandra', 'warren, Shana S","2018.0","American Political Science Review","Can positive social contact between members of antagonistic groups reduce prejudice and discrimination? Despite extensive research on social contact, observational studies are difficult to interpret because prejudiced people may select out of contact with out-group members.

There are several mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of such contact. This article presents a test of an affective mechanism of imagined contact by applying a facial feedback procedure. We used a physical blockade of the zygomaticus major muscle, known to constrain people's experience of emotional states. Participants imagining intergroup contact expressed more positive attitudes towards an outgroup when they could physically mimic a positive affective state by smiling, but there was no such effect when embodiment was constrained. The interactive effects on attitudes appeared due to greater perception of outgroup warmth. This study presents the first attempt to explain the role of embodiment in the improvement of intergroup relations. ¬© 2013 The British Psychological Society.","10.1111/bjso.12057","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901938720&doi=10.1111%2fbjso.12057&partnerID=40&md5=5930e1c184989498d953a1c88fd43e7c","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","-","21.26","4","poland","1","2","5","0:05","1 day","1","0","imagined contact","no imagined contact","3","attitude positivity toward Romanians","1.0","1.0","0.0","30.0","-","30.0","-","f.test","4.9","1.0","0.0","1.0","390.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","0.0",43

Unfortunately, the motivation to make contact with outgroup members is usually very low in such conflicts. We hypothesized that one limiting factor is the belief that groups cannot change, which leads to increased intergroup anxiety and decreased contact motivation. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated beliefs about group malleability in the context of the conflict between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and then assessed intergroup anxiety and motivation to engage in intergroup contact. Turkish Cypriots who were led to believe that groups can change (with no mention of the specific groups involved) reported lower levels of intergroup anxiety and higher motivation to interact and communicate with Greek Cypriots in the future, compared with those who were led to believe that groups cannot change. This effect of group malleability manipulation on contact motivation was mediated by intergroup anxiety.","10.1037/a0028620","https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-13963-001","Web of Science","0.0","2","1.0","-","35.64","8","Cyprus","1","1","9","0:05","1 day","1","0","malleability beliefs","fixed beliefs","8","willingness to have contact","1.0","1.0","0.0","31","-","31","-","dim","0.96","1.0","0.0","1.37","1194.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",46

This randomized pretest–posttest control group design investigates the ability of a brief empathy-inducing intervention to improve the implicit bias of pre-service teachers, as measured by the Implicit Association Test. We found the empathy intervention statistically significant at decreasing the implicit bias of White female pre-service teachers toward Black individuals (F = 7.55, η 2 = 0.22, p = 0.01). Implications and future research are discussed, including extended intervention periods. © The Author(s) 2018.","10.1177/0033294118767435","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062920074&doi=10.1177%2f0033294118767435&partnerID=40&md5=7c31334e7abaef23dba12e3e75620538","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","-","19.5","4","US","1","1","9","0:05","1 day","1","0","think about situations faced by Black students","elementary science lessons","2","IAT","-1.0","1.0","0.0","17.0","-","17.0","-","did","0.33","1.0","0.0","0.35","679, table 1","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",55

It also extended the sexual minority contact literature by examining the role of participant and interaction partner sex as a possible boundary condition of this contact–prejudice relationship. To test our hypotheses, 140 heterosexual female and male university students were randomly allocated to interact with a homosexual or heterosexual, female or male E-contact partner, in a collaborative and text-only online interaction before completing the outcome measures. Overall, the results demonstrated that interacting online with a female, as opposed to a male, homosexual E-contact partner reduced heterosexual men's feelings of intergroup anxiety, which in turn was associated with lower sexual prejudice and outgroup avoidance. For heterosexual women, however, E-contact did not influence the outcome variables. In the context of sexual prejudice, these results suggest that E-contact may be particularly useful as a prejudice-reduction strategy among individuals who typically require it most: heterosexual men.

However, few studies have tested the malleability of implicit age bias.

Method: Participants (N = 767) were randomly assigned to read 1 of 3 framed messages, to an unframed message about aging, or to a control message unrelated to aging. Framed messages emphasized (a) the contributions of older adults to society; (b) aging as a process of accumulating wisdom and energy; and (c) mechanisms through which prejudice against older adults operates. Participants subsequently completed an aging implicit association test (IAT) to assess implicit bias. Results: Relative to the control condition, participants in the 3 framed message conditions displayed lower implicit age bias.

"201","Implementation intentions reduce implicit stereotype activation and application","H. R. Rees, A. M. Rivers and J. W. Sherman","2019.0","Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","Research has found that implementation intentions, if–then action plans (e.g., 'if I see a Black face, I will think safe'), reduce stereotyping on implicit measures. However, it is unknown by what process(es) implementation intentions reduce implicit stereotyping. The present research examines the effects of implementation intentions on stereotype activation (e.g., extent to which stereotypic information is accessible) and stereotype application (e.g., extent to which accessible stereotypes are applied in judgment). In addition, we assessed the efficiency of implementation intentions by manipulating cognitive resources (e.g., digit-span, restricted response window) while participants made judgments on an implicit stereotyping measure. Across four studies, implementation intentions reduced implicit stereotyping. This decrease in stereotyping was associated with reductions in both stereotype activation and application. In addition, these effects of implementation intentions were highly efficient and associated with reduced stereotyping even for groups for which people may have little practice inhibiting stereotypes (e.g., gender).

"202","The effect of a serious game on empathy and prejudice of psychology students towards persons with disabilities","L. Olivier, P. Sterkenburg and E. van Rensburg","2019.0","African Journal of Disability","Background: Much has been done regarding the promotion of equality in rights in terms of legislation, but persons with disabilities remain marginalised in society. Negative attitudes and prejudice contribute towards numerous challenges for persons with disabilities. Objectives: This study investigated the level of empathy and prejudice of students towards persons with disabilities, and the effect of the use of a serious game to enhance empathy and reduce prejudice. Method: A randomised controlled experiment with pre-test, post-test and follow-up test was used. Availability sample (N = 83) of psychology university students (22% males; 78% females) was divided into an experimental group that played the serious game The World of Elva and two control groups. The first control group received texts on case studies and information on reacting in a sensitive and responsive way, and the second control group received no intervention. Results: Participants have average levels of empathy (score: 32 to 52) and strong prejudice (score: 0.08 to -0.87) towards persons with disabilities. The intervention results in a slight short-term effect for prejudice and sub-scale measurements of empathy. A slight improvement was noted in participants' ability to transpose themselves imaginatively into the experience of disabled characters. Conclusion: The findings contribute to the understanding of empathy as a dynamic component that can be positively influenced by, for example, a serious game. These results have teaching implications on the facilitation of empathy. The short-term effect on empathy and prejudice towards persons with disabilities may contribute to bridge the inequality experienced by persons with disabilities.","10.4102/ajod.v8i0.328",NA,NA,"0.0","3","1.0","-","21.87951807","4","south africa","1","8","9","0:20","1 day","0","0","computer game","no intervention control","2","IAT","-1.0","1.0","0.0","26.0","-","31.0","-","did","0.14","-1.0","0.0","0.35","43986.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",62

"215","Tweetment Effects on the Tweeted: Experimentally Reducing Racist Harassment","Munger K.","2017.0","Political Behavior","I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts I control (‚Äúbots‚Äù) to sanction the harassers.

This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","10.1007/s11109-016-9373-5","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994728020&doi=10.1007%2fs11109-016-9373-5&partnerID=40&md5=ed0ffda6aa4523dd1d58fef8223a6fe9","Scopus","1.0","3","1.0","-","-","9","US","2","1","3","0:05","1 day","1","1","outgroup / low","control","1","racist tweets","-1.0","2.0","2 months","46.0","-","43.0","-","reg.coef","0.007","-1.0","1.0","0.46","642.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",65

Research Design and Methods: The current investigation tested the PEACE (Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences) model for the first time. Two online experimental studies examined 2 key factors for reducing ageism: education about aging (providing accurate information about aging) and extended contact (knowledge of positive intergenerational contact) as well as their potential combined effect (education plus extended contact). Results and Discussion: In Study 1, 354 undergraduates in all 3 experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (delayed post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests), when controlling for pre-study attitudes. In Study 2, 505 national community participants (ages 18-59) in all experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (immediate post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests). In summary, across 2 online studies, education about aging and knowledge of intergenerational extended contact improved attitudes toward older adults and aging knowledge. Implications: Thus, brief, online ageism-reduction strategies can be an effective way to combat ageism. These strategies hold promise to be tested in other settings, with other samples, and to be elaborated into more in-depth interventions that aim to reduce ageism in everyday culture. © The Author(s) 2017.

Research Design and Methods: The current investigation tested the PEACE (Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences) model for the first time. Two online experimental studies examined 2 key factors for reducing ageism: education about aging (providing accurate information about aging) and extended contact (knowledge of positive intergenerational contact) as well as their potential combined effect (education plus extended contact). Results and Discussion: In Study 1, 354 undergraduates in all 3 experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (delayed post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests), when controlling for pre-study attitudes. In Study 2, 505 national community participants (ages 18-59) in all experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (immediate post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests). In summary, across 2 online studies, education about aging and knowledge of intergenerational extended contact improved attitudes toward older adults and aging knowledge. Implications: Thus, brief, online ageism-reduction strategies can be an effective way to combat ageism. These strategies hold promise to be tested in other settings, with other samples, and to be elaborated into more in-depth interventions that aim to reduce ageism in everyday culture. © The Author(s) 2017.

Research Design and Methods: The current investigation tested the PEACE (Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences) model for the first time. Two online experimental studies examined 2 key factors for reducing ageism: education about aging (providing accurate information about aging) and extended contact (knowledge of positive intergenerational contact) as well as their potential combined effect (education plus extended contact). Results and Discussion: In Study 1, 354 undergraduates in all 3 experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (delayed post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests), when controlling for pre-study attitudes. In Study 2, 505 national community participants (ages 18-59) in all experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported less negative attitudes toward older adults (immediate post-test) and greater aging knowledge (immediate and delayed post-tests). In summary, across 2 online studies, education about aging and knowledge of intergenerational extended contact improved attitudes toward older adults and aging knowledge.

Diesendruck","2019.0","Social Development","One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out-groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3- to 4- and 5- to 6- year-old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in- and out-group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in-group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out-group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out-group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out-group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out-group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3- to 4-year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out-group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","10.1111/sode.12408","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073790424&doi=10.1111%2fsode.12408&partnerID=40&md5=1572a7126a8ef8213ee610b33659b4ba","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","-","4.17","1","israel","1","1","14(providing information)","0:05","1 day","1","0","full information","no information","3","attitudes toward Palestinians","1.0","1.0","0.0","13.5","-","16","-","dim","0.94","1.0","0.0","0.92","11.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",67

"273","Bridging the Empathy Gap: Effects of Brief Mindfulness Training on Helping Outgroup Members in Need","Berry, Daniel R","2017.0",NA,"Witnessing others in need can be felt similarly to experiencing it oneself (empathy) and motivates assistance of those in need (prosocial action ). It is well-documented that empathy can occur automatically, but when those in need are not members of a social ingroup, empathy and prosocial action are undermined. One major ingroup‚Äîoutgroup division in American and in other countries is based on race. Although most condemn racial discrimination, empathy and prosocial action are often lower, however unintentionally, in interracial contexts. In light of this empathy gap, it is important to identify psychological factors that could bolster empathy and prosocial action toward racial outgroup members in need. This dissertation asked whether mindfulness training ‚Äì cultivating present-centered, receptive attention to one‚Äôs ongoing experiences ‚Äìincreases social sensitivity toward racial outgroup members, and is based on pilot research indicating that a brief mindfulness induction increased empathy and prosocial action in such contexts. Healthy, self-identifying White women were randomized to either a brief (4-day) mindfulness training or a structurally-equivalent sham mindfulness training. Pre-post electroencephalographic measures of empathy toward video stimuli of outgroup members expressing sadness was assessed via prefrontal alpha frequency oscillations (i.e., frontal alpha asymmetry). Pre-post scenario-based spontaneous prosocial action toward Black individuals in need, and pre-post 14-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of empathy and prosocial action toward Black individuals (and other races) were conducted. Mindfulness training was expected to increase EEG- and EMA-based empathy toward Black individuals in need, as well as increase prosocial action toward such individuals in scenario and daily life (EMA) contexts. Opposite of what was hypothesized, MT reduced post-intervention empathic simulation, relative to ST, as measured by frontal alpha asymmetry. Consistent with hypotheses, however, MT increased empathic concern for outgroup members expressing sadness during video stimuli observation, and increased post-intervention scenario-based prosocial action. However, the hypothesis that MT would predict increases in pre- to post-intervention daily EMA-based prosocial action was not supported. Providing somewhat convergent evidence, trait mindfulness predicted more frequent pre-intervention scenario-based and daily prosocial action toward outgroup members; trait mindfulness was not related to pre-intervention video-based EEG and self-reported empathy outcomes. Together these results suggest that mindfulness can enhance some indicators or empathy and prosocial behavior in interracial contexts.

We examined this question in two field experiments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We created two versions of an episode of an existing media intervention (a show aiming to promote positive social change), in which fictional characters either planned collective action (role modeling condition), or did not plan action (control condition) to address grievances. In Study 1, role modeling affected individual-level outcomes: it increased perceived collective efficacy and willingness to take action, but exacerbated intergroup attitudes and reduced tolerance. Study 2 tested the influence of role modeling on a group-level outcome (group discussions). Discussions following the role modeling show focused less on grievances, and included more positive lessons of the show, as well as more statements about collective efficacy and collective action. The findings highlight the influence of role modeling of collective action through media on efficacy and action for social change, but caution against unintended consequences on intergroup attitudes.","10.1016/j.jesp.2016.07.005","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116301068",NA,"0.0","3","1.0","1.0","30.5","6","Democratic Republic of the Congo","2","1, 11, 12","3","0:20","1 day","0","1","role modeling condition","no show control","3","negative intergroup attitudes","-1.0","1.0","0.0","88.0","12.0","92.0","12.0","dim","0.24","-1.0","0.0","0.61","205 table 2","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","1.0",70

Among mental illnesses, schizophrenia elicits uniquely strong negative biases (Angermeyer & Dietrich, 2006). One particularly effective mental illness stigma reduction strategy is the ‚Äúcontact hypothesis,‚Äù which postulates that face-to-face contact with an outgroup member will reduce intergroup anxiety (i.e., the emotional discomfort caused by contact with an outgroup member), and will encourage future intergroup interaction (Allport, 1954). As with many stigmatized conditions, individuals with schizophrenia tend to conceal their disorder (Smart & Wegner, 2000), which makes interaction between the general public and people with schizophrenia difficult to facilitate. To remedy this problem, researchers have shown that even imagining a face-to-face encounter with an outgroup member could have benefits that are on par with direct, face-to-face contact (Giacobbe, Stukas, & Farhall, 2013; Turner, Crisp, and Lambert, 2007). The effects of imagined contact as a means to change negative attitudes, emotional reactions, behavioral intentions, and behaviors have been tested immediately following the imagined contact intervention, however, the delayed effects (tested at 1 week following the intervention) have yet to be substantiated. The present research investigated the impact of imagined contact as a tool to reduce schizophrenia stigma among college students both immediately following the imagined contact (Immediate Version) and one week after (Delayed Version). In the imagined contact with schizophrenia group (experimental condition), participants listened to a recording which asked them to imagine a pleasant interaction with an individual with schizophrenia. The control group listened to a recording which asked them to imagine a pleasant interaction with an individual with no diagnosis. In the study, participants filled out self-report measures of attitudes, perception of dangerousness, and affect toward individuals with schizophrenia in a pretest survey and after the imagined contact task. Additionally, as behavioral measures, participants were asked to set up chairs in anticipation of a conversation with an individual with schizophrenia so that desired distance could be measured, as well as have a brief conversation with an individual they were told had schizophrenia. The longevity of the potential benefits from imagined contact were assessed by having about half of the participants in both the control and experimental conditions complete these measures immediately following the imagined contact intervention and about half complete the measures one week following the imagined contact. It was hypothesized that participants in the experimental group of both the immediate and delayed versions of the experiment would have a significant decrease in all the measures that reflect stigma toward individuals with schizophrenia and would perceive a higher interaction quality in the experimental conversation task, whereas the control group would remain stable. Instead, the present research failed to replicate previous research in the immediate version, and the delayed version had a similar pattern. The one exception to this pattern was that imagined contact was shown to improve perceived quality of the interaction from the perspective of the participant in the immediate version, however this effect did not hold true for participants in the delayed version of the experiment. Thus, the present study raises questions regarding the efficacy of imagined contact as an effective means to reduce mental illness stigma and in doing so underscores the value of replicating findings before extending investigations to new areas.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824073730",NA,"0.0","2","2.0","1a","18.71","4","us","1","8","5","0:10","1 day","1","0","imagined contact with an individual with schizophrenia","control contact","3","social distance","1.0","1.0","0.0","26.0","-","26.0","-","dim","0.08","1.0","0.0","9.36","35 table 2","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",73

"291","Immediate and Delayed Effects of Imagined Contact with an Individual with Schizophrenia on Mental Illness Stigma and Interaction Quality","Kaminetzky, Elliot M","2017.0",NA,"Mental illness stigma is pervasive and has detrimental consequences for those experiencing various mental illness diagnoses (Crisp, Gelder, Rix, Meltzer, & Rowlands, 2000). Among mental illnesses, schizophrenia elicits uniquely strong negative biases (Angermeyer & Dietrich, 2006). One particularly effective mental illness stigma reduction strategy is the ‚Äúcontact hypothesis,‚Äù which postulates that face-to-face contact with an outgroup member will reduce intergroup anxiety (i.e., the emotional discomfort caused by contact with an outgroup member), and will encourage future intergroup interaction (Allport, 1954). As with many stigmatized conditions, individuals with schizophrenia tend to conceal their disorder (Smart & Wegner, 2000), which makes interaction between the general public and people with schizophrenia difficult to facilitate. To remedy this problem, researchers have shown that even imagining a face-to-face encounter with an outgroup member could have benefits that are on par with direct, face-to-face contact (Giacobbe, Stukas, & Farhall, 2013; Turner, Crisp, and Lambert, 2007). The effects of imagined contact as a means to change negative attitudes, emotional reactions, behavioral intentions, and behaviors have been tested immediately following the imagined contact intervention, however, the delayed effects (tested at 1 week following the intervention) have yet to be substantiated. The present research investigated the impact of imagined contact as a tool to reduce schizophrenia stigma among college students both immediately following the imagined contact (Immediate Version) and one week after (Delayed Version). In the imagined contact with schizophrenia group (experimental condition), participants listened to a recording which asked them to imagine a pleasant interaction with an individual with schizophrenia. The control group listened to a recording which asked them to imagine a pleasant interaction with an individual with no diagnosis. In the study, participants filled out self-report measures of attitudes, perception of dangerousness, and affect toward individuals with schizophrenia in a pretest survey and after the imagined contact task. Additionally, as behavioral measures, participants were asked to set up chairs in anticipation of a conversation with an individual with schizophrenia so that desired distance could be measured, as well as have a brief conversation with an individual they were told had schizophrenia. The longevity of the potential benefits from imagined contact were assessed by having about half of the participants in both the control and experimental conditions complete these measures immediately following the imagined contact intervention and about half complete the measures one week following the imagined contact. It was hypothesized that participants in the experimental group of both the immediate and delayed versions of the experiment would have a significant decrease in all the measures that reflect stigma toward individuals with schizophrenia and would perceive a higher interaction quality in the experimental conversation task, whereas the control group would remain stable. Instead, the present research failed to replicate previous research in the immediate version, and the delayed version had a similar pattern. The one exception to this pattern was that imagined contact was shown to improve perceived quality of the interaction from the perspective of the participant in the immediate version, however this effect did not hold true for participants in the delayed version of the experiment. Thus, the present study raises questions regarding the efficacy of imagined contact as an effective means to reduce mental illness stigma and in doing so underscores the value of replicating findings before extending investigations to new areas.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824073730",NA,"0.0","2","2.0","1b","18.74545455","4","us","1","8","5","0:10","1 day","1","0","imagined contact with an individual with schizophrenia","control contact","1","chair distance","-1.0","2.0","1 week","25.0","-","30.0","-","t.test","1.4","-1.0","0.0","1.0","41.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",73

A comparison between implicit and explicit measures of prejudice found that implicit bias of able-bodied students was more entrenched than explicit biases.""]","10.1080/1034912X.2017.1316012","http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1034912X.2017.1316012",NA,"0.0","1","1.0","-","20","4","US","3","8","9","0:05","1 day","0","0","Video Exemplars","control","3","attitudes (ADS)","-1.0","1.0","0.0","90.0","-","91.0","-","dim","0.95","-1.0","0.0","11.35","652.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",77

One possibility is that cognitive retraining, such as by repeatedly practicing counterstereotypes, can reduce implicit bias so that stereotype application will be reduced in turn. Another possibility involves motivated self-regulation, where people's awareness of their proneness to biased responses heightens negative self-directed affect, which in turn facilitates monitoring for biases and reduces stereotype application. These possibilities were tested across three experiments. In all experiments, participants who completed counterstereotype training subsequently scored lower on a measure of implicit bias, relative to untrained participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, counterstereotyping did not reduce subsequent stereotype application; in Experiment 3, counterstereotyping did reduce stereotype application, but this effect was not mediated by implicit bias scores. Participants in the motivated self-regulation condition (Experiments 2 & 3) were primed with their proneness to respond in biased ways, which increased negative self-directed affect among participants more internally motivated to respond without bias. Participants' degree of negative self-directed affect was not consistently associated with implicit bias scores.

These results suggest that reductions of implicit bias through counterstereotype training do not, in turn, lead to reduced stereotype application. In contrast, the results support the viability of motivated self-regulation interventions that facilitate awareness of bias and heighten negative self-directed affect, thus creating the motivation to self-regulate stereotype application.""]","10.1016/j.jesp.2017.06.003","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116307831",NA,"0.0","3","1.0","3.0","35.26","9","US","3","1","9","0:05","1 day","1","0","Counterstereotype training","no training","3","joke evaluations","-1.0","1.0","0.0","70.0","-","67.0","-","dim","-0.15","1.0","0.0","2.16","106 table 7","0.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",79

"347","Empathy, Perspective-Taking and the Mere Exposure Effect: Understanding Adolescent Attitudes About Sexual Minorities and Reducing Prejudice Against Sexual Minority Youth","Mundy-Shephard, Adrienne Marie","2015.0",NA,"[""Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) youth face considerable discrimination and peer victimization, which has been associated with a number of negative health and educational outcomes. Few studies have been conducted to understand peer attitudes and how they vary based on demographic characteristics, including sex, race and religion, and no research has been conducted examining differences in attitudes between immigrant and native-born populations. This present study analyzes the attitudes about homosexuality and gender nonconformity held by high school students (N = 957) at a racially and ethnically diverse high school in the northeast, as measured by a brief survey. The author examines how tolerance of homosexuality differs based on sex, race, immigrant identity, religious affiliation and intergroup contact with LGB people. Analyses of the results indicate that there are large differences in attitudes among demographic subgroups of students. Following examination of these baseline attitudes, the author conducted an experiment assessing the impact of two interventions intended to increase tolerance of homosexuality and gender nonconformity. The first intervention consisted of an offer to participate in a one-on-one discussion about LGB people, including questions intended to increase empathy and engage students in perspective-taking as a means of prejudice reduction. The second intervention was based upon the mere exposure effect: the phenomenon that repeated exposures to a stimulus may enhance preference for that stimulus. This intervention consisted of multiple exposures over the course of an academic year to a questionnaire assessing students' attitudes about homosexuality and gender nonconformity. Analyses of the results of both experiments indicate that neither intervention had statistically significant impacts on prejudice reduction: the views of students who were initially accepting of LGBQ people remained positive at the conclusion of the study, while those students with pre-existing anti-LGBQ bias did not become more tolerant as a result of participation in the study, and in fact, less tolerant students appeared to experience a slight increase in prejudice. Further inquiry is needed to understand the reasons why these interventions had the opposite of the desired effect for intolerant students, in order to craft more appropriate prejudice-reduction strategies for students with pre-existing anti-LGBQ bias.""]",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1738990001","articles+","0.0","3","2.0","1.0","15.69","3","US","2","6","4","00:20","1 day","0","0","one-on-one discussion","pure control","3","tolerance of homosexuality and gender nonconformity","1.0","2.0","8 months","320.0","16","320.0","16","reg.coef","-0.033","-1.0","1.0","0.07120393248","page 93, table 4","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",83

Across five experiments (N = 2123) we examined how different news framings of obesity research influence these attitudes. We exposed participants to either a control condition, a news report on a study portraying obesity as a public health crisis, a news report on a study suggesting that obesity may not be as much of a problem as previously thought, or an article discussing weight-based discrimination. Compared to controls, exposure to the public health crisis article did not increase perception of obesity-related health risks but did significantly increase the expression of antifat prejudice in four out of seven comparisons. Across studies, compared to controls, participants who read an article about weight-based discrimination were less likely to agree that overweight constitutes a public health crisis or to support various obesity policies.

The multicultural perspective effectively reduced implicit prejudice when the perceived threat was low, but yielded no such observable effect when the perceived threat was high.","10.1111/jasp.12551","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12551', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/2132137259","articles+","0.0","2","1.0","2.0","22.16","4","Spain","1","1","8 and 9","00:05","1 day","1","1","multicultural perspective","placebo article","3","blatant prejudice","-1.0","1.0","0.0","38.0","-","36.0","-","-","0.0","0.0","0.0","-","page 613","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","1.0",85

"389","The mixed outcomes of taking ownership for implicit racial biases.","Cooley, Erin; Lei, Ryan F.; Ellerkamp, Taylor","2018.0","Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin","One potential strategy for prejudice reduction is encouraging people to acknowledge, and take ownership for, their implicit biases. Across two studies, we explore how taking ownership for implicit racial bias affects the subsequent expression of overt bias. Participants first completed an implicit measure of their attitudes toward Black people. Then we either led participants to think of their implicit bias as their own or as stemming from external factors. Results revealed that taking ownership for high implicit racial bias had diverging effects on subsequent warmth toward Black people (Study 1) and donations to a Black nonprofit (Study 2) based on people‚Äôs internal motivations to respond without prejudice (Internal Motivation Scale [IMS]).

Across two studies, we explore how taking ownership for implicit racial bias affects the subsequent expression of overt bias. Participants first completed an implicit measure of their attitudes toward Black people. Then we either led participants to think of their implicit bias as their own or as stemming from external factors. Results revealed that taking ownership for high implicit racial bias had diverging effects on subsequent warmth toward Black people (Study 1) and donations to a Black nonprofit (Study 2) based on people‚Äôs internal motivations to respond without prejudice (Internal Motivation Scale [IMS]). Critically, among those low in IMS, owning high implicit bias backfired, leading to greater overt prejudice and smaller donations.

Hanna","2019.0","European Journal of Social Psychology","Northern Ireland is characterised by extensive segregation between its predominantly Catholic and Protestant communities. With the aim of overcoming this segregation, the current study experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of electronic or E-contact as a novel indirect contact and prejudice-reduction strategy. Here, Catholic and Protestant participants were not required to meet physically but were involved in a collaborative and goal-orientated online interaction with a member of the other community. As predicted, E-contact improved both Catholics’ and Protestants’ outgroup attitudes via improved contact expectancies and reduced intergroup anxiety. These findings provide support for the contemporary role of online interactions in actively overcoming the physical and psychological barriers that often prevent prejudice reduction in segregated communities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/ejsp.2515","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050395656&doi=10.1002%2fejsp.2515&partnerID=40&md5=568c40a2e8c1f222ba2e1d2d3817cfe7","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","-","20.7","4, 9","UK","1","11","5","00:10","1 day","1","0","e-contact","placebo task","3","outgroup attitudes","1.0","1.0","0.0","46","-","40","-","dim","0.7648043478","1.0","0.0","1.22844146","page 29, table 1","1.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",96

"421","Encouraging children to mentalise about a perceived outgroup increases prosocial behaviour towards outgroup members","N. McLoughlin and H. Over","2019.0","Developmental Science","We investigated whether encouraging young children to discuss the mental states of an immigrant group would elicit more prosocial behaviour towards them and impact on their perception of a group member's emotional experience.

The present study tested exposure effects of an interactive narrative in which audience members adopt the perspective of an immigrant illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico. Results suggested that exposure to the interactive narrative engendered positive affect toward Mexicans in the U.S., which predicted support for social services that would benefit Mexican immigrants. Participants' enjoyment also positively predicted affect and support for social services benefiting Mexican immigrants.

As predicted by Optimal Distinctiveness Theory, the intervention served to worsen evaluations of an in-group target vis-√†-vis a control group that was not exposed to the intervention, and especially when applied on individuals possessing lower amounts of the in-group bias in question, ageism. Moreover, although age-based stereotyping and in-group bias against an older applicant was demonstrated, the intervention was found to have no effect in changing evaluations of an older target relative to the control group. Results and implications for future research are discussed.

"465","Brothers and sisters in arms: Intergroup cooperation in a violent shooter game can reduce intergroup bias","Adachi P.J.C., Hodson G., Willoughby T., Zanette S.","2015.0","Psychology of Violence","Objective: Video games increasingly have become multiplayer, and thus online video game players have the unique opportunity to cooperate with players from all over the world, including those who belong to different social groups. Consistent with research showing that intergroup cooperation leads to reductions in intergroup bias, playing a video game cooperatively with a member of a different social group (i.e., an outgroup member) may reduce bias. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to test whether playing a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup member reduces intergroup bias toward that partnera's group. Method: In our investigation, Canadians (n = 138) played a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup (American) or ingroup member against alien (i.e., zombie-like) enemies. Results: Cooperating with an outgroup member in a violent context for only 12 minutes generated large reductions in outgroup prejudice. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential for even violent video games to serve as prejudice interventions. ¬© 2014 American Psychological Association.","10.1037/a0037407","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84935015952&doi=10.1037%2fa0037407&partnerID=40&md5=1661006c61997409c1aca873953403d7","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","-","18.75","4","Canada","1","2","5","0:12","1 day","1","0","intergroup cooperation","intragroup cooperation","3","Intergroup Attitudes","1.0","1.0","0.0","69","-","69","-","did","-0.64","1.0","0.0","2.08","459.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",110

Study 1 demonstrated that anti-atheist prejudice among religious believers is reduced in countries in which atheists are especially prevalent. Study 2 demonstrated that perceived atheist prevalence is negatively associated with anti-atheist prejudice. Study 3 demonstrated a causal relationship: Reminders of atheist prevalence reduced explicit distrust of atheists. These results appeared distinct from intergroup contact effects. Study 4 demonstrated that prevalence information decreased implicit atheist distrust. The latter two experiments provide the first evidence that mere prevalence information can reduce prejudice against any outgroup. These findings offer insights about anti-atheist prejudice, a poorly understood phenomenon. Furthermore, they suggest both novel directions for future prejudice research and potential interventions that could reduce a variety of prejudices.

This study builds on first findings in this realm by distinguishing between different meaningful media contents.

"494","The fight against prejudice in older adults: Perspective taking effectiveness [Combatiendo el prejuicio en personas mayores: Efectividad de la toma de perspectiva]","Alvarez Castillo J.L., Equiz√°bal A.J., C√°mara C.P., Gonz√°lez H.G.","2014.0","Revista Latinoamericana de Psicologia","Inhibition of prejudice appears to be more problematic for older adults, hence the need to develop programs to reduce intergroup bias at later stages in life. Perspective taking was analyzed in this study, as one of various cognitive strategies that have been shown to reduce such bias. Data on a sample of 63 Spanish participants with a mean age of 64.1 years was gathered after an intervention based on mental imagery, aimed at reducing explicit prejudice. A wide array of variables was measured (personality traits, values, empathy, and attribution) which may moderate effectiveness in perspective taking. Despite no main effect was found, effects due to interaction of perspective taking found in OLS regression analysis revealed that perspective taking based intervention was effective for some older adults, particularly those who had low scores on agreeableness, empathy, and universalism, and high scores on conformity. The conclusions suggest that perspective taking might be successfully applied to some profles of older people albeit it is not as strong and transferable strategy as it used to be thought. ¬© 2011, Konrad Lorenz University Foundation.","10.1016/S0120-0534(14)70017-2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924295589&doi=10.1016%2fS0120-0534%2814%2970017-2&partnerID=40&md5=2fce646c86920de96a33df9d59ecd35c","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","-","64.13","4","Spain","1","2, 3","9","0:05","1 day","1","0","Perspective taking","same task without instructions","3","Explicit prejudice","-1.0","1.0","0.0","31.5","-","31.5","-","dim","-0.19","1.0","0.0","1.15","page 141","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",120

Results revealed that the activation of positive meta-stereotypes led Italian high-school students (high-status group) to anticipate greater enjoyment of an upcoming interaction with an African immigrant (low-status group) by increasing positive feelings about contact and concerns about being accepted. Initial prejudice emerged as the moderator, with the effects of positive meta-stereotypes present among those with average- to high-levels of prejudice. This study represents the first experimental demonstration that positive meta-stereotypes have beneficial effects for intergroup relations among high-status members.

Studies 1 (N\u2009=\u2009192) and 2 (N\u2009=\u200986) examined correlations between spontaneous favorability toward power (vs. universalism) values, achievement (vs. benevolence) values, and a spontaneous measure of prejudice toward ethnic minorities. Study 3 (N\u2009=\u2009159) tested whether conditioning participants to associate power values with positive adjectives and universalism values with negative adjectives (or inversely) affects spontaneous prejudice. Study 4 (N\u2009=\u200995) tested whether decision bias toward female handball players could be predicted by spontaneous attitude toward power (vs. universalism) values. Study 5 (N\u2009=\u2009123) examined correlations between spontaneous attitude toward power (vs. universalism) values, spontaneous importance toward power (vs. universalism) values, and spontaneous prejudice toward Black African people. Spontaneous positivity toward power (vs. universalism) values was associated with spontaneous negativity toward minorities and predicted gender bias in a decision task, whereas the explicit measures did not.

Paolini","2019.0","Group Processes and Intergroup Relations","Past research has ascertained the benefits of involuntary, “forced” exposure to positive imagined contact. This research explored determinants and consequences of actively chosen imagined contact in a setting of entrenched intergroup conflict. In Study 1, when given an unvalenced visualisation scenario enabling participants to steer the visualisation in any direction they wanted, Turkish Cypriots visualised an intergroup interaction nondistinguishable in quality to that of those assigned to a positive scenario. In Study 2, when asked to actively choose between visualising a positive or a negative intergroup interaction, Turkish Cypriots disproportionally preferred positive over negative contact. The chosen visualisation reflected mood and valenced confirmation biases and resulted in virtuous (vs. vicious) effects on group-level outcomes. These findings shed a first light on the psychological underpinnings of volitional intergroup imagery and indicate that intergroup imagery is a safe way of engaging with the outgroup even in contexts of entrenched conflict. © The Author(s) 2018.","10.1177%2F1368430217747405","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066404320&doi=10.1177%2f1368430217747405&partnerID=40&md5=a6a4666bc839c74c64f3a648754246c8","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","1.0","30.11","6","Cypress","1","1","5","0:05","1 day","1","0","Positive imagined contact","No contact control","3","Outgroup attitude improvement","1.0","1.0","0.0","42.0","-","44.0","-","dim","0.38","1.0","0.0","0.84","page 516","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",127

In a scripted role-play, participants were paired with a confederate who declared their character's sexual orientation as either heterosexual or homosexual. Hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that contact with homosexual individuals affected participants' attitudes toward gay men and lesbians over and above the participants' prior ATLG scores. A moderating effect for prior ATLG scores was also found. The effect of confederate's sexual orientation was stronger for participants with more negative ATLG scores compared to those with more favorable attitudes.

Our findings are important in understanding ways that promote positive intergroup relations in ways that align with the interests of young children. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","10.1111/sode.12374","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063295611&doi=10.1111%2fsode.12374&partnerID=40&md5=fccb27462fa82453a2db6d2a207f9f69","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","3.0","4.5","1","Italy","1","1","5",":20","1 day","1","0","Imagined contact condition","No imagined contact","1","Resource allocation bias","1.0","1.0","0.0","23.0","-","22.0","-","dim","0.91","1.0","0.0","1.31","1066.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",136

Traditionally, researchers have focused on reducing sexual prejudice; however, research indicates that heterosexuals’ concerns about being misidentified as gay/lesbian also contribute to the derogation of gay/lesbian individuals. Thus, reducing misidentification concerns is a critical part of decreasing negativity toward gay/lesbian individuals. In the current work, we explored a novel addition to the imagined contact paradigm—imagined contact with famous outgroup members—for reducing misidentification concerns. We found that imagined contact with famous gay men/lesbians reduced misidentification concerns within the imagined interaction and engendered an eagerness to befriend the famous gay/lesbian interaction partner. Moreover, we found that the reduction of these misidentification concerns led to fewer general contagion concerns, and increased eagerness to befriend led to decreased sexual prejudice.

However, little research has addressed how best to reduce gambling stigma. This study explored the effectiveness of video intervention styles, that have been used to reduce public stigma for conditions such as mental illness and substance use disorders. This was done to determine which would be most suitable, considering the unique characteristics of gambling disorder. An online survey of 164 people living in Australia was conducted which examined attitudes toward gamblers experiencing problems before and after an intervention. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three interventions (contact, education, advocacy) or a control video. The study found that each intervention was associated with changes to different components of stigma. Importantly, the education intervention increased labelling, but reduced stereotype endorsement and anger. Advocacy also reduced anger, attributions of character flaws, and anticipated discrimination and recoverability. While these interventions were generally effective at reducing stigma, the contact intervention was mixed, effectively intervening for some aspects of stigma, but increasing stigma on others. No single intervention reduced all aspects of stigma, suggesting that a complementary approach utilising specific elements of each intervention style could be used to deliver relevant information and effectively reduce stigma.

This was done to determine which would be most suitable, considering the unique characteristics of gambling disorder. An online survey of 164 people living in Australia was conducted which examined attitudes toward gamblers experiencing problems before and after an intervention. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three interventions (contact, education, advocacy) or a control video. The study found that each intervention was associated with changes to different components of stigma.

Participants either received positive feedback about their ingroup‚s performance, positive feedback about their personal performance, or no feedback. Participants then provided judgments toward Blacks. Across both experiments, participants who received the ingroup performance feedback expressed the lowest levels of anti-Black prejudice, but Experiment 2 indicated this effect was limited to strongly White-identified participants.

"606","Colorblind and Multicultural Prejudice Reduction Strategies in High-Conflict Situations","'Correll, Joshua Park, Bernadette', 'Allegra Smith, J',","2008.0","Group Processes & Intergroup Relations","We tested colorblind and multicultural prejudice-reduction strategies under conditions of low and high interethnic conflict. Replicating previous work, both strategies reduced prejudice when conflict was low. But when conflict was high, only the colorblind strategy reduced prejudice (Studies 1 and 2). Interestingly, this colorblind response seemed to reflect suppression. When prejudice was assessed more subtly (with implicit measures), colorblind participants demonstrated bias equivalent to multicultural participants (Study 2). And, after a delay, colorblind participants showed a rebound, demonstrating greater prejudice than their multicultural counterparts (Study 3). Similar effects were obtained when ideology was measured rather than manipulated (Study 4). We suggest that conflict challenges the tenets of a colorblind ideology (predicated on the absence of group differences) but not those of a multicultural ideology (which acknowledges difference).","10.1177/1368430208095401","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1368430208095401', 'https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00571700', 'https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::e1c70d91187bcb0d19492181d8195bb1","articles+","0.0","2","1.0","2.0","20","4","US","1","1","8","0:05","1 Day","1","0","CB","control","2","Implicit (log-ms)","-1.0","1.0","0.0","38.0","-","38.0","-","dim","-0.0035","1.0","0.0","0.1485210423","p. 480, Table 2","1.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",144

"628","Recovery Speaks: A Photovoice Intervention to Reduce Stigma Among Primary Care Providers","Flanagan, Elizabeth H.; Buck, Tona; Gamble, Alfred; Hunter, Cynthia; Sewell, Ira; Davidson, Larry","2016.0","PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES","Objective: Preliminary findings are reported from a photovoice intervention, ""Recovery Speaks,"" to reduce primary care provider stigma in regard to people with mental illness and addiction. Methods: Twenty-seven primary care providers were recruited through a practice-based research network. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention-attending a one-hour performance followed by discussion-or to no intervention. Provider stigma was evaluated by using established measures of stigma and recovery and qualitative responses. Linear mixed models controlling for baseline differences compared changes in provider stigma across time and groups.

Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed.

"640","Effectiveness of an anti-stigma training on improving attitudes and decreasing discrimination towards people with mental disorders among care assistant workers in Guangzhou, China","J. Li, Y. Fan, H. Q. Zhong, X. L. Duan, W. Chen, S. Evans-Lacko and G. Thornicroft","2019.0","International Journal of Mental Health Systems","Background: Care assistant workers as a new pattern of care providers in China play an important role in bridging the mental health treatment gap. Stigma and discrimination against people with mental disorders among care assistant workers is a barrier which adversely influences mental health service delivery. However, programs aimed at reducing stigma among care assistant workers are rare in China. Methods: A total of 293 care assistant workers from four districts of Guangzhou, China were randomly divided into an intervention group (n = 139) and a control group (n = 154). The intervention group received anti-stigma training and the control group received traditional mental health training. Both trainings lasted for 3 h. Participants were measured before and after training using Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD), Mental illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) and Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test, Chi square test or Fisher's exact test. Multilinear regression models were performed to calculate adjusted regression coefficient of the intervention on PPD, MAKS, and MICA. Results: There were significant lower scores on PDD and MICA in the intervention group after training when compared with the control group (both P < 0.001). No significant difference was found on MAKS total score between the two groups after training (P = 0.118). Both groups had better correct identification of schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder before and after training. Conclusions: These findings suggest that anti-stigma training may be effective in reducing the perception of devaluation-discrimination against people with mental illness and decreasing the level of negative stigma-related mental health attitudes among care assistant workers. © 2019 The Author(s).",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059504453&doi=10.1186%2fs13033-018-0259-2&partnerID=40&md5=4b586f9309f5f3a7bf2d9c289e20af1e","Scopus C7 - 1","0.0","2","1.0","-","39.03","5","China","2","8","11","1:00","1 Day","0","0","anti-stigma training","traditional mental health training","3","Mental illness clinicians' attitudes (MICA)","-1.0","1.0","0.0","139.0","-","154.0","-","did","3.8","1.0","0.0","7.7","p. 6","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",153

In two pilot studies and Experiment 1, we found that extant and desired cross-group friendships and cues of social connectedness to an out-group member predicted increased interest in the target group’s culture. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated cues of social connectedness between non–Latino American participants and a Latino American (i.e., Mexican American) peer and whether participants freely worked with this peer on a Mexican cultural task. This experience reduced the participants’ implicit bias against Latinos, an effect that was mediated by increased cultural engagement, and, 6 months later in an unrelated context, improved intergroup outcomes (e.g., interest in interacting with Mexican Americans; Experiment 4). The Discussion section addresses the inter- and intragroup benefits of policies that encourage people to express and share diverse cultural interests in mainstream settings.","10.1177/0956797613481607","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885342275&doi=10.1177%2f0956797613481607&partnerID=40&md5=6c6031488cf9be104e7e86bba65ed3f0","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","2.0","20","4","US","1","1","8","0:15","1 day","0","0","social connection/Mexican","no-social connection/Mexican","2","White-Latino lexical Implicit Association Test","-1.0","1.0","0.0","29","-","29","-","d","0.75","1.0","0.0","1.0","1951.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","0.0",154

In the current study, glucose was manipulated via lemonade sweetened with either sugar or Splenda. Compared to the control group, the participants in the glucose condition used fewer stereotypes when writing an essay about a day in the life of a gay man. In addition, high-prejudice participants in the glucose condition used fewer derogatory statements in their essays than high-prejudice participants in the control condition.

Unlike live poker, players and watchers, typically cannot rely on physical cues of other players; in fact, the only information often available to poker players is others' nationality. Because these poker games often involve members of different national groups, it constitutes a context of indirect contact that has considerable potential to examine how attitudes and beliefs about people from other nationalities can be influenced by interactions in online poker. In the current research, we examined how observing an in_group player have positive or negative contact with a player of another nationality impacted one's own attitudes and beliefs about the out_group nation. Participants (N = 157) watched an online poker video recording of a fellow in_group member have negative, positive, or no intergroup contact with an out_group member at an online poker table. Subsequent affective (out_group attitudes) and cognitive (perceived out_group variability) measures of intergroup bias were taken. Data revealed that while observing negative contact increased out_group prejudice, observing positive contact reduced prejudice (all relative to no intergroup contact).

Unlike live poker, players and watchers, typically cannot rely on physical cues of other players; in fact, the only information often available to poker players is others' nationality. Because these poker games often involve members of different national groups, it constitutes a context of indirect contact that has considerable potential to examine how attitudes and beliefs about people from other nationalities can be influenced by interactions in online poker. In the current research, we examined how observing an in_group player have positive or negative contact with a player of another nationality impacted one's own attitudes and beliefs about the out_group nation. Participants (N = 157) watched an online poker video recording of a fellow in_group member have negative, positive, or no intergroup contact with an out_group member at an online poker table. Subsequent affective (out_group attitudes) and cognitive (perceived out_group variability) measures of intergroup bias were taken. Data revealed that while observing negative contact increased out_group prejudice, observing positive contact reduced prejudice (all relative to no intergroup contact). However, no differences were found in perceived out_group variability.

Hypothesis: Pupils in the intervention condition will express less discrimination about a man characterised as having experienced psychosis immediately after the workshop and at follow-up, compared with pupils in the control condition. Method: A cluster randomised trial was carried out in order to take into account the effect of class group.

Such embodiment results in a perceptual illusion of body ownership over the virtual body (VB). Previous research has shown that the form of the VB can influence implicit attitudes. In particular, embodying White people in a Black virtual body is associated with an immediate decrease in their implicit racial bias against Black people. We tested whether the reduction in implicit bias lasts for at least 1 week and whether it is enhanced by multiple exposures. Two experiments were carried out with a total of 90 female participants where the virtual body was either Black or White. Participants were required to follow a virtual Tai Chi teacher who was either Asian or European Caucasian. Each participant had 1, 2, or 3 exposures separated by days. Implicit racial bias was measured 1 week before their first exposure and 1 week after their last. The results show that implicit bias decreased more for those with the Black virtual body than the White. There was also some evidence of a general decrease in bias independently of body type for which possible explanations are put forward. ¬© 2016 Banakou, Hanumanthu and Slater.","10.3389/fnhum.2016.00601","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007497541&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2016.00601&partnerID=40&md5=0cd6779633258bd78277afc3dcda1054","Scopus","0.0","2","1.0","1.0","21.9","4","Spain","1","1","9","1:10","3 days","0","1","black embodiment","white embodiment","2","implicit racial bias (IAT)","-1.0","2.0","1 week","29.0","-","30.0","-","dim","-0.24","1.0","0.0","0.3012474066","6.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",160

In such contexts, becoming familiar and learning to empathize with the other side may reduce stress. Building on the long-lasting Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we developed an eight-week group intervention focused on dialogue and empathy and tested it within a randomized controlled trial. Eighty-eight Israeli-Jewish and Arab-Palestinian adolescents (16-18\u202fyears) were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Before(T1) and after(T2) intervention, one-on-one interaction with outgroup member was videotaped, cortisol levels assessed five times during a 2.5-hour session involving exposure to outgroup stimuli, and adolescents were interviewed regarding national conflict. Intervention reduced cortisol response to social contact and reminders of outgroup (F\u202f=\u202f4.92, p\u202f=\u202f.032, Eta \u202f=\u202f0.109). This HPA-activity suppression was defined by two pathways. First, intervention had a direct impact on cortisol decrease; and second, intervention increased youth's behavioral empathy during one-on-one interaction with outgroup member and this empathic response mediated the effect of intervention on cortisol reduction. Adolescents' belief in the potential for reconciliation at T1 predicted greater empathy at T2. Our study provides the first evidence-based intervention for youth growing up amidst intractable conflict and demonstrates its impact on adolescents' physiological stress response to outgroup. Results contribute to research on the neurobiology of ingroup/outgroup relations, highlight the key role of dialogical empathy and social interactions for interventions targeting youth, and emphasize the importance of enhancing motivation for social inclusion for initiating positive behavioral and physiological processes.

Study 1 (disadvantaged Kurds, N = 80) showed that imagined contact increased collective action tendencies and this effect was mediated by increased perceived discrimination and ethnic identification. Study 2 (advantaged Turks, N = 127) demonstrated that imagined contact also directly increased collective action tendencies, as well as perceived discrimination and relative deprivation among the advantaged group. No significant mediation emerged. At the same time, in line with literature, imagined contact led only the advantaged group members to display more positive outgroup attitudes. Findings suggest that in settings where ingroup identities and conflict are salient, imagined contact may not readily undermine motivation for social change among group members.","10.1016/j.ijintrel.2018.12.003","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176718303444",NA,"0.0","2.0","1.0","2.0","22.43","4.0","Turkey","1.0","1.0","5.0","0.003472222222222222","1 day","1.0","0.0","imagined contact","imagined trekking","3,9","outgroup attitudes","1.0","1.0","0.0","59.0","-","68.0","-","dim","4.07","1.0","0.0","22.35","39, table 2","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","1.0",173

"728","Near and Dear? Evaluating the Impact of Neighbor Diversity on Inter-Religious Attitudes","Barnhardt, Sharon","2010.0","-","This paper provides experimental evidence on whether having religiously different neighbors affects attitudes about other religious groups and/or preferences for interreligious living. I exploit a natural experiment in a large Indian city in which Hindus and Muslims were randomly assigned units in a public housing complex with physically distinct ""clusters"" of four units. The lottery generates exogenous variation in the degree of religious diversity across clusters within the complex. I conduct an original survey of 1363 household that focuses on explicit and implicit attitudes about members of the other religion and willingness to live together. My estimates demonstrate that location influences interactions, in that individuals spend significant time with others in their cluster. Increased proximity and interaction, in turn, affect attitudes. Greater exposure to Muslims (the minority group) improves Hindus' explicit attitudes about Muslims by 0.25 to 0.40 standard deviations, depending on the measure, and increases their willingness to live with Muslims.

Across 2 studies we examined the effect of controlled, dyadic interactions on attitudes towards the ‚Äòother‚Äô in members of groups involved in ideological conflict. Study 1 involved Mexican immigrants and White Americans in Arizona, and Study 2 involved Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East.

We extended research on imagined contact by testing an elaborated task variant designed specifically to enhance future contact intentions. In three experiments imagined contact heightened intentions, elaborated imagery enhanced this effect, and these enhancements were attributable to both reduced intergroup anxiety and an increase in the reported vividness of the imagined scenario. Furthermore, prior contact enhanced the vividness with which imagined scenarios were envisaged, with concurrent benefits for future contact intentions. Results also supported the notion that elaboration creates a more accessible contact script upon which to base future judgments of intention. We discuss the implications of these findings for a developing model of imagined contact effects.","10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.014","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103110001307",NA,"0.0","2.0","1.0","1.0","20.5","4","uk","1","11","5","0:02","1 day","1","0","imagined contact","outdoors control","8","intentions to engage in future contact","1.0","1.0","0.0","16.5","-","16.5","-","dim","1.24","1.0","0.0","1.26","945.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",188

Although extensive research has revealed that NFC is related to derogatory behavioural tendencies and negative emotions towards stereotyped groups, it is proposed that NFC may also be linked to positive attitudes towards outgroups. It is predicted, however, that this would be true only when NFC is accompanied by a low ability to achieve closure (AAC). It is argued that low AAC impairs the construction of schema and their effective application. Therefore, NFC in individuals with low AAC may lead them to correct their initial tendency to use stereotypes and, as a consequence, to evaluate a negatively stereotyped outgroup in a positive way. In this research, low AAC was assessed by a scale (Study 1) and experimentally induced (Study 2). In both studies, we measured positive attitudes towards Gypsies. The results of the studies supported our prediction that NFC is positively related to positive attitudes towards Gypsies when AAC is low.","10.1007/s11031-014-9414-5","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25598561', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1643366534', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826613178', 'https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::3dc7658d7fdb53a3b8082528dbf39388",NA,"0.0","2.0","1.0","2.0","21","4","poland","1","1","9","0:10","1 day","1","0","helplessness","control","3","attitudes toward Gypsies","1.0","1.0","0.0","27","-","27","-","t.test","-2.4375","-1.0","1.0","-","94.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",189

"798","[""The Impact of an Educational Intervention on People's Attitudes Regarding the Negative Stereotypes of Muslims""]","Laiq, Ahmad","2011.0",NA,"[""The lack of knowledge about the true values and tenets of Islam, coupled with the increased acts of terrorism committed by radical fundamentalists both in Europe and in the United States over the last decade, have led to a disconnect between the Western and Islamic cultures. The American public knows very little about the true nature of Islam and Muslims; most of their perceptions are based on negative stereotypes presented in the media (Suleiman, 1999). The purpose of this study was to determine what impact, if any, an educational intervention had on people's attitudes regarding the negative stereotypes of Muslims. Three research questions guided this study: 1. Will an educational intervention decrease the belief that Islam is associated with terrorism? 2. Will an educational intervention decrease negative stereotypes of Muslims as measured by the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (1925)? 3. What is the impact of age, religion, educational level, gender, and ethnicity on people's attitude about negative stereotypes of Muslims? The research methodology chosen for this study was descriptive survey utilizing mixed methods. The research took place at a private urban university located in a large metropolitan area in the Midwest. A sample of 100 undergraduate and graduate students was randomly divided into an experimental and control group. The experimental group watched an educational DVD regarding Islam and Muslims. All students completed the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (1925) which is a 7-item instrument using a Guttman Scale. Two student focus groups validated the data generated by the quantitative findings. The results were generally consistent with Bogardus' (1925) findings regarding the distance between participants and members of the other group. Results from the quantitative analyses revealed that the short educational DVD had a significant impact on lessening the extent to which people viewed Islam as being associated with terrorism as determined by conducting a one-way ANOVA. However, the brief educational intervention was not enough to change people's overall negative stereotypes about Muslims in everyday situations. In addition, the qualitative responses of this study shed light on what may impact negative stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. The research concluded that although one cannot imply that a short educational DVD will erase social distance attitudes about Islam and Muslims, education does influence positive changes in people's attitudes to some extent.""]",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/917734188","articles+","0.0","3.0","2.0","-","27.5","4","us","2","11","11","0:05","1 day","1","0","educational dvd","control","3","The Islamic religion endorses the use of terrorism","1.0","1.0","0.0","52.0","-","46.0","-","dim","0.52","1.0","0.0","0.75","89.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",193

However, if norm pressure has led to a substantial decrease in the public expression of prejudice against certain targets (e.g., blacks, women, blind people), little theoretical and empirical attention has been paid to the role of this general norm regarding sexual minorities (e.g., prostitutes, lesbians and gays). In this sense, the issue we want to address is whether general anti-prejudice norms can reduce the expression of prejudice against homosexual individuals. In this research we investigate the effect of activating an anti-prejudice norm against homosexuals on blatant and subtle expressions of prejudice. The anti-prejudice norm was experimentally manipulated and its effects were observed on rejection to intimacy (blatant prejudice) and on positive-negative emotions (subtle prejudice) regarding homosexuals. 136 university students were randomly allocated to activated-norm and control conditions and completed a questionnaire that included norm manipulation and the dependent variables. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) as well as subsequent ANOVAS showed that only in the high normative pressure condition participants expressed less rejection to intimacy and less negative emotions against homosexuals, when compared to the simple norm-activation and the control conditions.

We concluded that a high anti-prejudice pressure regarding homosexuals could reduce blatant prejudice but not subtle prejudice, considering that the expression of negative emotions decreased while the expression of positive emotions remained stable.","10.1017/S1138741600001943","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19899658', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/274571384', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/734132103","articles+","0.0","3.0","1.0","-","20","4","portugal","1","6","3","0:01","1 day","1","0","high normative condition","control","6","positive emotions","1.0","1.0","0.0","47.0","-","44.0","-","dim","-0.08","-1.0","0.0","1.05","581.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",196

Previous studies have demonstrated medical student bias toward obese individuals, but few have examined effects of the educational environment on these prejudicial beliefs.

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial enrolling medical students (n = 129) from three universities. Students were assigned to play-reading or a standard lecture. Explicit attitudes and implicit bias toward obese individuals were assessed prior to intervention and after four months. At baseline, students demonstrated moderate explicit and implicit bias toward obese people despite high scores on empathy. Students randomized to the play-reading group had significantly decreased explicit fat bias (P = 0.01) at follow-up, while students in the lecture group showed increased endorsement of a prescriptive model of care at the expense of a patient-centered approach (P = 0.03). There was a significant increase in empathy for those in both the theater (P = 0.007) and lecture group (P = 0.02).

"840","Literal intergroup contact: Embodied relational cues and the reduction of intergroup bias","Seger, Charles R","2010.0","-","[""Existing evidence shows that a brief, casual interpersonal touch results in positive behavior toward the toucher. Theoretically this effect arises because touch is an embodied cue to friendship or closeness, as demonstrated by its role in attachment and relationship development. According to research on intergroup contact, feelings of friendship toward an individual outgroup member reduce prejudice toward the entire social group. This research examined whether the effects of touch extend beyond the toucher as an individual, to influence feelings about that individual's social group. The initial study demonstrates that interpersonal touch decreases implicit, though not explicit, prejudice toward the toucher‚Äôs social group (African Americans). The second study replicated this effect for African American and Asian touchers, while also demonstrating a novel effect: touch increases participants‚Äô general tendency to report empathic emotions in response to scenarios in which others were treated negatively. In the third study, half of the participants formed a negative attitude toward the African American toucher before the touch. Although touch did not affect implicit prejudice toward African Americans, touch did buffer the effects of a negatively evaluated toucher on implicit evaluations of the group. An implicit measure of self-esteem was unrelated to the implicit attitude measure. Throughout these studies, implicit evaluations of other social groups (e.g., Caucasians) were not affected by touch. Not only are these results unique in demonstrating that the effects of interpersonal touch can extend beyond the toucher to an entire social group, they suggest that the these effects of touch are automatic and occur outside of conscious awareness.""]",NA,"http://www.riss.kr/pdu/ddodLink.do?id=T12690056', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/725996759","articles+","0.0","2.0","2.0","3.0","20","4","usa","1","1","4","0:01","1 day","1","0","black woman - light touch","black woman no touch","2","implicit attidues towards Blacks","1.0","1.0","0.0","18.5","-","18.5","-","dim","-95.25","-1.0","0.0","191.29","Table 7, p.83","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",203

"894","Ethnic Prejudice in Young Children in Indonesia: Intervention Attempts Using Multicultural Friendship Stories","Brown, Christia Spears', 'Tam, Michelle', 'Aboud, Frances","2018.0","International Journal of Early Childhood","Ethnic prejudice, even among very young children, is a universal occurrence. Yet, little research has been conducted on this issue outside of Westernized contexts. The current study evaluated a storybook intervention in Indonesia, a country of historically high racial tensions, designed to reduce young children‚s ethnic bias regarding out-groups of high-status (i.e., Chinese) and low-status (i.e., Papuan). In Study 1, 138 children, aged from 4 to 7\xa0years, participated and included 87 children in an intervention group. The children were read two stories about cross-ethnic friendships over 2\xa0days. Children‚s attitudes were evaluated before and after the storybook reading using the Multi-response Racial Attitude measure and a social distance measure. Analyses indicated minimal to no effectiveness of the intervention. These findings were replicated in Study 2 with 20 children who received an enhanced intervention procedure by being read five different stories about cross-ethnic friendships, each book read two times over the course of 5\xa0weeks, followed by discussions about the messages in the stories. Again, there was no reduction in racial bias. The combined lack of prejudice reduction across Study 1 and Study 2 emphasized how strong racial bias for lowest status, ethnic out-groups develops from an early age and that these prejudices are difficult to change, warranting greater attention in early childhood educational research.Le prjug ethnique, m™me chez de tr®s jeunes enfants, est universellement prsent. Cette question a nanmoins suscit tr®s peu de recherches en dehors de contextes occidentaliss. La prsente tude a valu, en Indonsie, pays dont l‚histoire est marque de fortes tensions raciales, une intervention au moyen de livres d‚histoires conßue pour rduire chez de jeunes enfants le biais ethnique envers des groupes externes de statut lev (c.-†-d. chinois) et de statut faible (c.-†-d. papous). L‚tude 1 comprenait 138 enfants ¢gs de 4 † 7 ans, dont 87 dans un groupe d‚intervention. Deux histoires sur des amitis interethniques taient lues aux enfants pendant deux jours,. Les attitudes des enfants taient values avant et apr®s la lecture des livres d‚histoires au moyen de la mesure de l‚attitude raciale † rponse multiple (MRA, Multi-Response Racial Attitude), ainsi que d‚une mesure de distance sociale. Les analyses rv®lent une efficacit de l‚intervention de minimale † nulle. Ces rsultats se sont rpts dans l‚tude 2 oπ 20 enfants ont suivi une procdure d‚intervention renforce par la lecture de cinq diffrents rcits d‚amitis interethniques, chaque livre tant lu deux fois sur une priode de cinq semaines, et suivi de discussions sur les messages de ces histoires. Une fois de plus, le biais racial n‚tait pas diminu. L‚absence de rduction des prjugs tant dans l‚tude 1 que dans l‚tude 2 souligne la force du biais racial envers les groupes ethniques externes au statut le plus faible, son dveloppement d®s le jeune ¢ge, et la difficult de changer de tels prjugs, justifiant ainsi que la recherche en ducation de la petite enfance y accorde une plus grande attention.Aun entre los m°s peque±os, los prejuicios tnicos son de incidencia universal. Sin embargo, son muy pocos los estudios que se han hecho sobre el tema fuera del °mbito cultural occidentalizado. El presente estudio evalu≥ la intervenci≥n de un libro de cuentos en Indonesia, un pa≠s con una historia de elevada tensi≥n racial. Los relatos fueron dise±ados con el prop≥sito de reducir los prejuicios tnicos en ni±os peque±os con respecto a grupos excluidos de posici≥n social elevada (el grupo chino) y de posici≥n social baja (el grupo pap∫). En el Estudio 1 participaron 138 ni±os de 4 a 7 a±os de edad y se incluyeron 87 ni±os en un grupo de intervenci≥n. A lo largo de dos d≠as se les leyeron a los ni±os 2 relatos sobre amistades inter-tnicas. Usando el mtodo para medir Respuestas M∫ltiples Sobre Actitudes Raciales (MRA, por su sigla en ingls) y la medici≥n de distancia social, se evalu≥ la actitud de los ni±os antes y despus de la lectura de los cuentos. Los an°lisis indicaron que la intervenci≥n hab≠a sido de efectividad m≠nima o nula. El Estudio 2 arroj≥ resultados similares. En l se expuso a 20 ni±os a un procedimiento de intervenci≥n amplificada al lerseles 5 relatos diferentes sobre amistades intertnicas; durante un periodo de 5 semanas cada libro fue le≠do dos veces, y luego la lectura fue seguida por una conversaci≥n sobre los mensajes de los cuentos. Nuevamente no se observ≥ una reducci≥n del prejuicio racial.

Yet, little research has been conducted on this issue outside of Westernized contexts. The current study evaluated a storybook intervention in Indonesia, a country of historically high racial tensions, designed to reduce young children‚s ethnic bias regarding out-groups of high-status (i.e., Chinese) and low-status (i.e., Papuan). In Study 1, 138 children, aged from 4 to 7\xa0years, participated and included 87 children in an intervention group. The children were read two stories about cross-ethnic friendships over 2\xa0days. Children‚s attitudes were evaluated before and after the storybook reading using the Multi-response Racial Attitude measure and a social distance measure. Analyses indicated minimal to no effectiveness of the intervention. These findings were replicated in Study 2 with 20 children who received an enhanced intervention procedure by being read five different stories about cross-ethnic friendships, each book read two times over the course of 5\xa0weeks, followed by discussions about the messages in the stories. Again, there was no reduction in racial bias. The combined lack of prejudice reduction across Study 1 and Study 2 emphasized how strong racial bias for lowest status, ethnic out-groups develops from an early age and that these prejudices are difficult to change, warranting greater attention in early childhood educational research.Le prjug ethnique, m™me chez de tr®s jeunes enfants, est universellement prsent.

"915","Age Discrimination in Hiring Practices: A Quantitative Analysis","Pinkas, Catherine Irene","2018.0",NA,"Ageism, or discrimination based on assumptions about abilities and cognitive understanding based on a worker‚s age, still prevails in the modern workplace, often disguised as business decisions, lack of advancement opportunities, and continuing mandatory retirement ages. Additionally, negative assumptions about younger workers also exist, some of which harm young workers in the workplace. All forms of ageism have negative effects on the workplace, such as disrupting morale, being dismissive of the experiences and value that older workers contribute, and in return set precedence for other forms of discrimination. Ageism can impact everyone in the workplace. Although the passage of anti-discrimination legislation has curtailed some of the more obvious forms of discrimination, the psychological underpinnings behind age- discriminatory behavior still exist and must be mitigated to ensure a fair playing field for all people. In this study, the researcher examined ways a worker can be discriminated against based on assumptions about age and explores ways discriminatory behavior can be mitigated. Furthermore, the full extent to which anti-discrimination legislation has provided a positive, and occasionally negative impact is also discussed. Discrimination never truly goes away; it only changes form. When the psychological motivators behind discrimination are not properly addressed, managers themselves might harbor discriminatory assumptions about their workers. A quantitative method was employed to identify factors and determine the best ways to combat factors that contribute to age discrimination. The findings indicated that some forms of ageism can be combatted by using certain forms of cognitive conditioning and self-assessment for hiring managers. All of the participants were hiring managers who took part in cognitive exercises designed to gain information about their opinions, but also induce a self-reflective means of evaluating their own prejudices. The evidence indicated that some factors, such as gender, do not play as large of a role as previously assumed, but that the age of the manager does play a small role in age discrimination in hiring. It was concluded that ageism does still exist, but that these assumptions can be countered effectively, which implies that better sensitivity and managerial training could be beneficial for hiring managers.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/2034087725","articles+","0.0","2.0","2.0","-","40","5","usa","1","5","9","0:20","1 day","0","0","perspective-taking video","control game","3","The Attitudes towards Older Workers Scale","1.0","1.0","0.0","37.0","-","44.0","-","did","-9.88","1.0","0.0","8.374","112.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",217

"920","Contact and Explicit and Implicit Bias Towards Latinos/as","Koech, Jasmine Maria","2016.0",NA,"The positive effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction have been well established, with prior research demonstrating that real or imagined contact with outgroup members can reduce implicit and explicit racial bias (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Turner, Crisp, & Lambert, 2007). The current research assessed non-Latinos‚Äô to more closely examine the relationship between contact and explicit bias (Study 1) and implicit bias (Study 2) towards Latinos. Additionally, this work examined if imagining a contact scenario with a Latino stranger was sufficient in reducing bias compared to those imagining contact with a stranger of unspecified race/ethnicity and if this effect could be mediated by alleviation of each integrated threat theory classifications (realistic threat, symbolic threat, intergroup anxiety, and negative stereotypes; Stephan & Stephan, 1996). Study 1 results indicated that the individuals with more close, current contact with Latinos exhibited lower explicit bias towards this racial/ethnic group. Study 2 replicated Study 1‚Äôs finding that current, close contact predicted explicit bias to an extent, although Study 2 provided little evidence to support that current, close contact is a predictor of implicit bias (i.e., stereotypic associations, attention allocation, and affect) towards Latinos. Study 3‚Äôs manipulation of imagined contact did not yield differences in biases (neither implicit nor explicit) between the two groups. However, there were significant relationships between implicit associations, explicit biases, and each of the four threat classifications.

Relative to a non-affirmed control, the family/friends affirmation did not actually increase prejudice; however, other affirmations decreased bias. Study 3 replicated the finding that prejudice was higher among participants who affirmed to family/friends compared to those who affirmed to other values, and showed a mediator of the effect: the endorsement of traditional family values. That is, affirming to family/friends was associated with support for family values, which was positively associated with prejudice. These findings add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential for self-affirmation to reduce bias, but establish that the type of value affirmed is an important consideration.

Hypotheses about the consequences of this association for perceptions of people with AIDS were derived from terror management theory, which proposes that mortality salience increases derogation of those who threaten people's worldviews unless those worldviews oppose prejudice, in which case mortality salience can increase acceptance of people who are otherwise threatening. Consistent with these hypotheses, conservative participants had less favorable impressions (Study 2) and liberal participants had more favorable impressions (Study 3) of a target with AIDS following a death reminder. Study 4 suggested that the decrease in prejudice among liberals following mortality salience was a genuine decrease in prejudice (as indicated by responses to an unobtrusive attitude measure), not just an increase in the desire to appear nonprejudiced.

"956","Effects of training intervention on hiring discrimination and rater prejudice","Lopez, Maria D","2009.0",NA,"The present study examined the effects of a training intervention on reducing hiring discrimination (perceived job suitability ratings) and rater prejudice against Middle-Eastern applicants. Additionally, the moderating effects of individuals' motivation to learn and openness to experience on the relationships among these variables were investigated. A total of 196 college students participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition (attending a training program) or the control group. The study consisted of an online survey phase, in which participants responded to measures assessing their openness to experience and prejudice attitude, and a computer lab-based phase in which participants role-played a company's recruiters and reviewed applicants' resumes for job suitability levels. The training intervention included a video clip and a perspective-taking exercise, focusing on raising participants' awareness of biases against minority members of a group. The findings showed that there were no significant differences in participants' ratings and rankings of Middle-Eastern job applicants between the two conditions. However, an interesting interaction effect was found between training and raters' openness to experience for themixed Middle-Eastern resume; specifically, in the control group, those who were higher on openness gave higher job suitability ratings than those who were lower on openness to experience, however in the training group no significant difference was found between these two groups. This means that even those who are low on openness to experience could be trained not to engage in hiring discrimination. The practical and theoretical implications of the findings were discussed.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/305181140","articles+","0.0","3.0","2.0","-","20.11","4","US","1","1","9, 11","0:20","1 day","1","0","diversity and perspective taking training","control","3","perceived job suitability rating","1.0","1.0","0.0","103.0","-","93.0","-","dim","0.04","1.0","0.0","0.5","43.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","0.0",231

Although people today are unlikely to be called ""racist"" unless they commit a blatant act of racism, to date millions of Americans have been told they hold racial bias against Blacks through an online implicit measure of prejudice‚Äîthe Race-Implicit Associations Test (R-IAT). To date, no one has examined the consequences of bias feedback from the R-IAT. With two studies I investigated how Whites responded to bias feedback from the R-IAT, how these responses were affected when people were told the R-IAT was a measure of ""racism"" (as opposed to other forms of bias), and the factors that moderated these responses. Specifically, we investigated whether people\'s intuitions that they may harbor subtle racial biases (or ""bias awareness"") predicted their reactions to this feedback. I created a new measure called the bias awareness scale to test this proposition across both studies. In Study I, I randomly assigned participants to receive high or low bias R-IAT feedback. Results revealed that participants who received high (vs. low) bias feedback experienced more negative affect. However, these results were qualified by participants\' levels of bias awareness. When accused (vs. not) of being racially biased, participants who were high in bias awareness were more likely to experience negative affect and to commit their time to diversity activities. In contrast, low bias aware individuals dedicated less time to diversity activities. The main goal of Study 2 was to extend Study 1\'s findings by focusing on the potential meanings of the ""high bias"" feedback to participants.

Students were randomly assigned to a control (N=102) or an experimental group (N=97). The experimental group was directed to an online, interactive patient simulation that featured an Arab American Muslim patient, and both groups completed a modified Clinical Cultural Competence Questionnaire to assess their knowledge, skills, and attitudes about culturally competent healthcare in general and specific to Arab American Muslim patients.There were knowledge and skills differences on two outcome measures for Arab American Muslim cultural competence measures in the experimental group. Across all of the measures, bilingual participants scored higher than English-speaking‚Äîonly participants.Preliminary data support the hypothesis that an online, interactive patient simulation involving the care of an Arab American Muslim patient has the potential to improve the knowledge and skills of 2nd-year medical students regarding the care of Arab American Muslim patients beyond the basic cultural-competence curriculum.","10.1176/appi.ap.35.5.312","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22007089', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/916310676', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/899130952","articles+","0.0","3.0","1.0","-","20","4","US","3","1, 11","12","00:45","1 day","0","0","online interactive simulation","pure control","3","cross-cultural comfort","1.0","1.0","0.0","97.0","-","102.0","-","dim","0.06","1.0","0.0","1.306483831","page 315, table 1","1.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",240

The goal of the current study is to assess the impact of two different video interventions involving indirect contact with persons with mental illness on reducing stigma. The first focused on personal stories of those experiencing mental illness. The second focused on the stories of friends and family members in their support of those experiencing mental illness.

Both studies provide evidence that the effects were driven by identity threat, surprise, and lower levels of disagreement.","10.1177/0146167217736048","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217736048', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29052459', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1954063867","articles+","0.0","2.0","1.0","2.0","39.27","9","Israel","3","1, 2","9","00:12","4 weeks","0","0","paradoxical thinking","control","3","openness to alternative information","1.0","1.0","0.0","177.0","-","144.0","-","-","0.0","0.0","1.0","-","page 132","-","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",244

Using people with schizophrenia as the target group, this experiment is the first to demonstrate that extended contact can reduce explicit prejudice, buffer stress responses to future interactions, improve non-verbal behavior, and improve the quality of interactions in a manner detectable by the target group member. Participants watched a video of a brief, positive interaction between two strangers, one of whom they were led to believe had schizophrenia. Control participants watched the same video without being told that the person had schizophrenia. They then participated in a social interaction with a confederate whom they were led to believe had the disorder. Participants' cardiovascular and electrodermal activity were monitored immediately before the interaction. The interaction was also secretly recorded to allow independent judges to assess the participants' non-verbal behaviors. The confederate also rated the positivity of each interaction. Participants in the extended contact condition reported more positive attitudes toward people with schizophrenia, displayed more positive non-verbal behaviors, and had a more positive interaction with the confederate. Moreover, just prior to the interaction, participants in the extended contact condition displayed smaller anticipatory stress responses, as reflected in smaller changes in interbeat interval and non-specific skin conductance responses during this phase.

"1057","Intergroup contact experience in dialogues on race groups: Does empathy and an informational identity style help explain prejudice reduction?","Markowicz, Jocelyn A","2009.0",NA,"This study sought to examine whether color-blind racism would decrease due to intergroup contact experience in Dialogue on Race (DOR) groups and to determine the factors related to reduction. Group cohesion and group leader characteristics were also examined to determine if the groups were working as expected. The participants for this study were 74 culturally diverse undergraduate students. The study was a pre- and post-test design with an intervention and control condition. During the pre-test administration all participants completed a survey (made of several instruments) via PsychData, an online research website. In addition, intervention condition participants also completed, within their respective Dialogue on Race (DOR) course groups, a measure of group cohesion and group leader characteristics during the pre-test administration. All participants completed a post-test survey within their respective Dialogue on Race course (DOR) groups. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition. After random assignment to condition, stratified sampling was used to assign participants to respective groups within each condition. Group cohesion was assessed by the group cohesion subscale of the Group Environment Scale (GES; Moos, 1994). Group leader characteristics were assessed by the Counselor Rating Form-Short (CRF-S; Corrigan & Schmidt, 1983). Color-blind racism was assessed by the Color-blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS; Neville, Lilly, Lee, Duran, & Browne, 2000). Empathy was assessed by two measures: Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983) and Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES; Mehrabian, 1996). Informational identity style was assessed by the Identity Style Inventory-Third Revision (ISI3; Berzonsky, 1997). Repeated measures univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance were used to assess the first research question: Does intergroup contact significantly increase empathy and informational identity style, and decrease color-blind racism? The first analyses employed examined change in group cohesion and group leader characteristics (trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertness). There was a significant increase in group cohesion within each intervention condition group. There were no significant differences in leader trustworthiness, attractiveness, and expertness within and across groups. These findings suggest that the groups were operating as expected and members' experiences were not significantly different based on group leader quality. The second analyses directly examined the study research questions. Contrary to the hypothesis, there was no significant decrease in color-blind racism. Second, there was no significant increase in empathy. Third, there was no significant increase in informational identity style. Although significant changes were not present, trends suggest that perhaps with greater statistical power the trends observed might be significant. Since a significant change in color-blind racism was not found exploratory analyses were conducted to examine the second research question: What explains change in color-blind racism? Three separate sequential multiple regressions were used to examine each of the three subscales of the CoBRAS (i.e., unawareness of racial privilege, unawareness of institutional discrimination, and unawareness of blatant racial issues). Group cohesion was entered into the first block of each regression, empathic concern was entered into the second block, and informational identity style was entered into the third block. Contrary to the hypothesis group cohesion, empathic concern, and informational identity style did not account for a significant amount of the variance in unawareness of racial privilege and unawareness of blatant racial issues. However, group cohesion, empathic concern, and informational identity did contribute a significant amount of variance in unawareness of institutional discrimination. In particular, informational identity style accounted for the most variance in unawareness of institutional discrimination. The results of this study were inconsistent with past research that suggested that intergroup contact experience reduced prejudice. Results of the study did however provide some support that an informational identity style may help explain reduction in prejudice (unawareness of institutional discrimination) as a result of intergroup contact experience. Understanding factors that explain prejudice reduction due to intergroup contact experience may improve intergroup dialogue programming in various organizations and universities nationwide.

Contrary to the hypothesis group cohesion, empathic concern, and informational identity style did not account for a significant amount of the variance in unawareness of racial privilege and unawareness of blatant racial issues. However, group cohesion, empathic concern, and informational identity did contribute a significant amount of variance in unawareness of institutional discrimination. In particular, informational identity style accounted for the most variance in unawareness of institutional discrimination. The results of this study were inconsistent with past research that suggested that intergroup contact experience reduced prejudice. Results of the study did however provide some support that an informational identity style may help explain reduction in prejudice (unawareness of institutional discrimination) as a result of intergroup contact experience. Understanding factors that explain prejudice reduction due to intergroup contact experience may improve intergroup dialogue programming in various organizations and universities nationwide. In a post-2008 presidential election era it becomes increasing important to have meaningful and successful intergroup contact.

"1061","An Experimental Study on the Effects of Stereotype Awareness on the Subjective Grading of Undergraduate College Essays","Mikesell-Redding, Danielle","2012.0","-","Racial equality is promoted on nearly every academic campus across America; however, research has shown that educators express racial bias in various ways. The purpose of this experimental research was to determine the extent of racial bias among White, undergraduate professors, an area lacking previous research. The study tested whether a statement describing such bias, presented to those in the experimental group, given prior to grading could be used to suppress discriminatory evaluations. Grounded in social identity theory, it was hypothesized that White instructors would grade an essay written by a Black student lower than a White student; however, this difference was expected to dissipate with the insertion of the statement of stereotype awareness. A total of 180 White undergraduate college instructors (39% male) were recruited from higher education listservs. A 2x2, between-subjects, factorial design was performed in which the two independent variables were the racial designation of the essayist (i.e., White or Black) and statement of stereotype awareness (i.e. presence or absence). The dependent variable was the singular percentage (i.e., 0-100) grade on the essay. Regardless of stereotype awareness, White instructors were significantly more likely to grade Black students an average of 4 points higher than White students. Simply mentioning the possibility of racial bias in education (i.e., stereotype awareness) elevated grades for both races by about 5 points. In an effort to avoid discriminating against Black students, White instructors overcompensated by grading higher. Understanding how prejudice presents itself in today's academic institutions has positive social implications for developing effective techniques to reduce bias and discrimination in the classroom.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027602325","articles+","0.0","2.0","2.0","-","48","4,5","US","1","1","11","0:01","1 day","1","0","stereotype awareness","stereotype absence","1","essay grade difference","-1.0","1.0","0.0","95","-","85","-","did","-3.73","1.0","0.0","13.31","53.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",251

In this paper we experimentally test this prediction offered by Garry Becker in his seminal work on taste based discrimination, in the context of caste in India, with management students (potential employers in the near future) as subjects. First, we measure caste prejudice and show that awareness through a TV social program reduces implicit prejudice against the lower caste and the reduction is sustained over time. Second, we find that the treatment reduces the prejudice levels of those in the left tail of the prejudice distribution--the group which can potentially affect real outcomes as predicted by the theory.

"1076","How we think they see us? Valence and difficulty of retrieval as moderators of the effect of meta-stereotype activation on intergroup orientations","Vazquez, Alexandra, Gomez, Angel, Yzerbyt, Vincent, Dovidio, John F","2017.0","International Journal of Psychology","Previous research indicates that meta -stereotypes are predominantly negative. However, the valence of the meta -stereotypes may not be the only factor accounting for the detrimental effects associated with their activation. In addition to valence, we propose that the subjective difficulty of retrieving the meta -stereotype might critically determine whether its activation deteriorates intergroup orientations.

This research was the attempt to employ both the experimental and quasi-experimental methods to examine the role of collective guilt on preferences for Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution strategies. In general, the study showed that collective guilt was facilitated by experimental manipulation. The greater collective guilt was provoked in groups with Israeli guilt and ambiguous information. Baltic respondents were more ready to accommodate and collaborate than Israeli respondents. In general, collective guilt and age facilitated a collaborating strategy, but the perceived legitimacy of group relationships and glorification predicted a competing strategy. The more one felt collective guilt, the greater the readiness was to cooperate. The stronger the identification with Jewish people, the less the readiness was to collaborate with the out-group.","10.17265/2159-5542/2014.04.005","http://lib.cqvip.com/qk/71230X/201404/49448297.html","articles+","0.0","2.0","1.0","-","23.3","4,7","Israel","1","1, 2","14(pure information)","0:05","1 day","1","0","Israeli guilt facts","neutral facts","3","Readiness for Social Contact","1.0","1.0","0.0","30","-","30","-","dim","0.12","1.0","0.0","1.06","278.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","1.0",260

Whites, however, may be hesitant to develop intergroup friendships because they experience negative emotions like anxiety when faced with the prospect of interacting with outgroup members (i.e., Blacks). Past research has countered this obstacle by relying on manipulations that reframe how individuals feel about intergroup interactions to increase willingness to engage with outgroup members. Building on this framework, I tested whether savoring a previous intergroup interaction could increase friendship willingness by increasing positive intergroup emotions (Study 1) and whether processing style would moderate this effect (Study 2). Results indicated that although White individuals were able to savor previous interactions with Blacks, encouraging them to do so did little to increase intergroup friendship willingness and this effect was not mediated by positive intergroup emotions. Moreover, processing style did not moderate this effect. However, trait savoring was linked with both positive intergroup emotions and increased intergroup friendship willingness. These findings suggest that although savoring a previous intergroup interaction may not be an effective way to encourage intergroup friendship willingness, individual differences in the capacity to savor may explain why some are more willing to seek intergroup friendships.",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1551756226","articles+","0.0","2.0","2.0","1.0","36.29","9","US","3","1","5","0:02","1 day","1","0","Black (all recall conditions","White (all recall conditions)","3","intergroup Friendship Willingness","1.0","1.0","-","78","-","78","-","dim","-0.03","-1.0","0.0","1.12","55.0","0.0",NA,"1.0","0.0","0.0",262

This attributional pattern is directly related to stereotyping, because attributing negative behaviors to internal, stable causes tends to perpetuate negative stereotypes of outgroup members. Recent research on implicit bias reduction revealed that circumventing individuals‚Äô tendency to engage in the ultimate attribution error led to reduced stereotyping. More specifically, training White participants to consider situational factors in determining Blacks‚Äô negative stereotypic behaviors led to decreased automatic stereotype activation. This technique was named Situational Attribution Training (Stewart, Latu, Kawakami, & Myers, 2010). In the current studies, I investigated the mechanisms and moderators of Situational Attribution Training. In Study 1, I investigated the effect of training on spontaneous situational inferences. Findings revealed that training did not increase spontaneous situational inferences: both training and control participants showed evidence of spontaneous situational inferences. In Study 2, I investigated whether correcting trait inferences by taking into account situational factors has become automatic after training. In addition, explicit prejudice, motivations to control prejudice, and cognitive complexity variables (need for cognition, personal need for structure) were investigated as moderators of training success. These findings revealed that Situational Attribution Training works best for individuals high in need for cognition, under conditions of no cognitive load, but not high cognitive load. Training increased implicit bias for individuals high in modern racism, regardless of their cognitive load.

This behavioral immune system effectively promotes disease avoidance but also results in an overgeneralized prejudice toward people who are not legitimate carriers of disease. In three studies, we tested whether experiences with two modern forms of disease protection (vaccination and hand washing) attenuate the relationship between concerns about disease and prejudice against out-groups. Study 1 demonstrated that when threatened with disease, vaccinated participants exhibited less prejudice toward immigrants than unvaccinated participants did. In Study 2, we found that framing vaccination messages in terms of immunity eliminated the relationship between chronic germ aversion and prejudice. In Study 3, we directly manipulated participants' protection from disease by having some participants wash their hands and found that this intervention significantly influenced participants' perceptions of out-group members. Our research suggests that public-health interventions can benefit society in areas beyond immediate health-related domains by informing novel, modern remedies for prejudice.""]","10.1177/0956797611417261","https://www.jstor.org/stable/41416974', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611417261', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22058107', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/911942729', 'https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=od________88::0f5b384377d2f7321b221c9302bd097c","articles+","0.0","2.0","1.0","3.0","20","4","US","1","3,5,7,8,11","14 (hand washing)","0:01","1 day","1","0","Hand wash","control","3","Outgroup attitude","1.0","1.0","0.0","13.0","-","13.0","-","-","0.0","0.0","-","-","page 1554","1.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0",268

Across three studies I examined individuals‚Äô reactions to system threatening information versus low threat in the context of an intragroup or intergroup interaction. In general, priming dominant group members with system threat (versus low threat) led to less negative intergroup interaction behavior. Specifically, being primed with system unfairness led dominant group members in Study 1 to express more positive other-directed remarks during a written exchange with an ostensible outgroup member. Study 2, conducted with a different minority group than Study 1, found that dominant group members feel more guilt when interacting with minority group members versus members of their own group in the face of system threat. Finally, a face-to-face intergroup interaction study replicated the positive behavioral effects of salient system threat found in Study 1, this time manifest in increased nonverbal friendliness and self-disclosure for both pair members.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether prejudice towards offenders would decrease after engagement with incarcerated serious offenders, and whether any improvement would be explained by increased empathic responding. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì An experimental field study was conducted. A repeated measures questionnaire assessed empathy and prejudice at two time points: before and after engagement with serious offenders. Findings ‚Äì As predicted experiencing actual engagement with convicted sex offenders and murderers within a prison environment did increase empathy and decrease prejudice towards ex-offenders. Research limitations/implications ‚Äì All participants were applied criminology students and (prison visited) is not representative of prisons within HM Prison Service. It could be argued that responding was influenced by previous knowledge of criminal justice and penal systems. Future research should consider examining the impact of engagement on empathy and prejudice with a larger, na√Øve sample and across different prisons. Originality/value ‚Äì As the first (to the authors knowledge) to empirically examine attitude change of individuals with no personal experience of offenders this research has value to any person considering how social exclusion may be reduced at a societal level.","10.1108/JCP-06-2013-0016","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCP-06-2013-0016', 'https://search.proquest.com/docview/1508525893","articles+","0.0","3.0","1.0","-","22.01","4","United Kingdom","2","12 (inmates)","4","5:00","1 day","0","0","Prison tour","control","3","Attitudes Toward Prisoners Scale","-1.0","1.0","0.0","87.0","-","56.0","-","dim","-0.12","1.0","0.0","0.26","37.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",281

Results suggest that social consensus information is an effective strategy to reduce weight prejudice.""]",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492361581","articles+","0.0","2.0","2.0","-","12.81732283","1,2,3,4","US","1","7","3","00:10","1 day","1","0","Weight storybook","numbers storybook","3","weight-related stereotypes","1.0","1.0","0.0","64.0","-","61.0","-","did","-0.78","1.0","0.0","1.49","30.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",284

Studies suggest that discussions and information about transgender people can reduce transphobia. However, these studies also indicate that experimental treatments do not necessarily affect individual attitudes on policies concerning transgender rights. Scholars contend that durably reducing prejudice should increase public support for minority rights. In this study, we examine this causal mechanism utilizing an experiment. We find that reducing transphobia is a reliable mechanism to increase public support for transgender rights. These results are robust to causal identification assumptions, suggesting that this mechanism provides a clear avenue for stigmatized groups to increase public support of rights for those groups.","10.1177/2053168018764945","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168018764945', 'https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=doajarticles::282e4fd2c0ff204a6b1889f272bb412e', 'https://doaj.org/article/8468d3d45f3b43f9a9aec7413aa4c928","articles+","0.0","2.0","1.0","-","-","9","US","3","9","14 (pure information)","0:05","1 day","1","1","no image + information

The purpose of this dissertation is to test whether bias decreases when intergroup cooperation improves the probability of goal achievement (i.e., is instrumental) and increases bias when intergroup cooperation reduces the probability of goal achievement (i.e., is dysfunctional). Three studies investigated and supported this hypothesis. The first study used real world data from groups with a pre-existing history of conflict. The first study used Catholic and Protestant university students in Northern Ireland and assessed their perceptions of the instrumentality of intergroup relations and their feelings of warmth and forgiveness toward the religious outgroup. The second study established causality as well as distinguished instrumentality from the mutual intergroup differentiation model in a laboratory context. To establish causality the second study directly manipulated perceptions of instrumentality by explaining to participants that because of their respectively different thinking styles it would be instrumental or dysfunctional to work with another group. In a control condition no information was offered about instrumentality. To distinguish instrumentality from the mutual intergroup differentiation model, which emphasizes the importance that groups maintain distinctive identities during interactions, the second study also manipulated participants' abilities to differentiate the in- from the out-group. Although bias was lowest under instrumental conditions, bias actually increased when the groups were more clearly differentiated from each other during the cooperative interaction. The third study established factors that influence instrumentality and distinguished instrumentality from reinforcement. To assess factors that influence instrumentality, the third study manipulated the relative skill of the ingroup (high or low) and how the two groups' contributions would be combined (adding or averaging). When the intergroup performance was calculated by adding all participants' scores, working together was instrumental for each group. However, when the performance was calculated by averaging each person's contribution to derive the intergroup score, cooperation was dysfunctional (they would have preferred to work separately) for the highly skilled group as they could achieve a higher score working alone. The results revealed that intergroup bias was lower when cooperation was instrumental than when it was dysfunctional. To distinguish instrumentality from a reinforcement perspective, I assessed how much the instrumental conditions produced positive affect (which was assumed to be a proxy for reinforcement) and then assessed whether instrumentality had unique effects on bias controlling for reinforcement. Although there was no main effect of instrumentality on positive affect, instrumentality no longer related to intergroup bias when positive affect was statistically controlled. However, when controlling for positive affect there is a reliable negative relationship between perceived instrumentality and bias.

The purpose of this dissertation is to test whether bias decreases when intergroup cooperation improves the probability of goal achievement (i.e., is instrumental) and increases bias when intergroup cooperation reduces the probability of goal achievement (i.e., is dysfunctional). Three studies investigated and supported this hypothesis. The first study used real world data from groups with a pre-existing history of conflict. The first study used Catholic and Protestant university students in Northern Ireland and assessed their perceptions of the instrumentality of intergroup relations and their feelings of warmth and forgiveness toward the religious outgroup. The second study established causality as well as distinguished instrumentality from the mutual intergroup differentiation model in a laboratory context. To establish causality the second study directly manipulated perceptions of instrumentality by explaining to participants that because of their respectively different thinking styles it would be instrumental or dysfunctional to work with another group. In a control condition no information was offered about instrumentality. To distinguish instrumentality from the mutual intergroup differentiation model, which emphasizes the importance that groups maintain distinctive identities during interactions, the second study also manipulated participants' abilities to differentiate the in- from the out-group. Although bias was lowest under instrumental conditions, bias actually increased when the groups were more clearly differentiated from each other during the cooperative interaction. The third study established factors that influence instrumentality and distinguished instrumentality from reinforcement. To assess factors that influence instrumentality, the third study manipulated the relative skill of the ingroup (high or low) and how the two groups' contributions would be combined (adding or averaging). When the intergroup performance was calculated by adding all participants' scores, working together was instrumental for each group. However, when the performance was calculated by averaging each person's contribution to derive the intergroup score, cooperation was dysfunctional (they would have preferred to work separately) for the highly skilled group as they could achieve a higher score working alone. The results revealed that intergroup bias was lower when cooperation was instrumental than when it was dysfunctional. To distinguish instrumentality from a reinforcement perspective, I assessed how much the instrumental conditions produced positive affect (which was assumed to be a proxy for reinforcement) and then assessed whether instrumentality had unique effects on bias controlling for reinforcement. Although there was no main effect of instrumentality on positive affect, instrumentality no longer related to intergroup bias when positive affect was statistically controlled. However, when controlling for positive affect there is a reliable negative relationship between perceived instrumentality and bias. Therefore, whether the effects of instrumentality on intergroup bias are completely independent of reinforcement is equivocal at this time.""]",NA,"https://search.proquest.com/docview/275780913","articles+","0.0","3.0","2.0","2.0","20","4","US","1","10","8","1:00","1 day","0","0","instrumentality","neutral","3","bias","-1.0","1.0","0.0","86.66666667","-","86.66666667","-","dim","-0.24","1.0","0.0","0.14","41, 7","1.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","0.0",290

This study leverages one of the most significant humanitarian crises of our time to test whether, and under what conditions, American citizens adopt more inclusionary behavior toward Syr- ian refugees. We conduct a nationally representative survey of over 5,000 American citizens in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election and experimentally test whether a perspective-taking exercise increases inclusionary behavior in the form of an anonymous letter supportive of refugees to be sent to the 45th President of the United States. Our results indi- cate that the perspective-taking message increases the likelihood of writing such a positive letter by two to five percentage points. By contrast, an informational message had no signifi- cant effect on letter writing. The effect of the perspective-taking exercise occurs in the short run only, manifests as a behav- ioral rather than an attitudinal response, and is strongest among Democrats. However, this effect also appears in the subset of Republican respondents, suggesting that efforts to promote per- spective taking may move to action a wide cross-section of individuals.","10.1073/pnas.1804002115","https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/38/9521.full.pdf","Seth","1.0","3.0","1.0","-","-","9","US","3","3","14 (pure information)","0:02","1 day","1","1","pure information","control","1","writing supportive letter","1.0","1.0","0.0","900.0","-","900.0","-","reg.coef","0.05635772","1.0","0.0","0.7014670501","Appendix section 7","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0",308
